# Lecture

## Welcome & Warm-Up

- Who here has used **R** or **Python** before?
  - Beginner / never used  
  - Some hands-on  
  - Intermediate  
  - Expert
- Have you heard of **text mining**?
- Have you ever run **topic modeling**?

## What is Text Mining?

- Computational methods for analyzing **large collections of text**
- Common goals
  - Patterns
  - Themes/Topics
  - Sentiment
  - Named entities
  
## What is Topic Modeling?

- A family of techniques that analyze **"bags" or groups of words together**
- Captures **broader context** instead of just word counts
- Helps find **latent themes** in text collections
- Use cases
  - Literature & historical corpora
  - News & social media
- cf. cluster analysis: 1 document <> 1 cluster
  - Each document may contain **multiple topics** with different probabilities
  - Use iterative Bayesian algorithms

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

- Most common algorithm for topic models => infer the hidden topic structure using the observed documents [@blei2012]
- Principles [@silge2017]
  - Every document = a **mixture of topics**
  - Every topic = a **mixture of words** => words can be shared between topics
- Outputs
  - **Top words** for each topic  
    - e.g. Topic 1 (Genetics): human, genome, dna, genetic, gene; Topic 2 (Evolution): evolution, evolutionary, species, organisms, life; Topic 3 (Disease): disease, host, bacteria, deceases, resistance 
  - **Topic probabilities** for each document  
    - Document A => 0.57 Topic 1, 0.35 Topic 2, 0.08 Topic 3

## Limitations

- **"Bag of words"** assumption: ignore word order and semantic meaning
- **"Reading tea leaves"** problem [@chang2009]: # topics and interpretation are subjective/arbitrary
- **Needs human judgment**: validation and expertise required

## Historian's Application and Critique: Jo Guldi

<u>Parliament's Debates about Infrastructure</u> [@guldi2019]

- Applies topic modeling and dynamic topic modeling to synthesize the historical record, with different degrees of granularity for analysis: 4 / 10 / 100 / 500 / 1000 topics
- **80/20 rule**: 80% of the findings conform to what scholars already know, but the remaining 20% may revealing new patterns
  - e.g., the word "Shannon" appeared earlier in a discussion of river improvement and drainage, than the more familiar Thames in the same topic (p. 7)
- Institutional divides: Army vs. Navy; Conservatives vs. Liberals
- Geographical and temporal/dialectical shifts

## Comparison of Topic Modeling Methods

<!-- height: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; -->

::: {style="font-size: 12pt;"}

| Feature / Method | **LDA** [@blei2003] | **BERTopic** [@grootendorst2022] | **TopicGPT** [@pham2024] |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Probabilistic topic model (Bayesian) | Transformer-based embeddings + clustering + class-based TF-IDF | LLM / GPT-based prompting and summarization |
| **Best for** | Longer text (hundreds of words per document) | Short text (tweets, headlines), mixed-length corpora | Flexible lengths |
| **Input Representation** | Bag of words | Dense semantic embeddings | Natural-language prompts |
| **Output** | Topic-word distributions; document-topic probabilities | Human-readable topic labels automatically; cluster assignments | Natural-language topic labels; coherent summaries |
| **Interpretability** | Requires human reading of top words | Usually more coherent topics | Often most interpretable |
| **Computational Cost** | Low–moderate | Moderate; depends on embedding model | High; relies on LLM inference |
| **Libraries / Tools** | `topicmodels`, `stm` (R), `gensim`, `scikit-learn` (Python), MALLET | `bertopic` (Python) | custom LLM pipelines |
| **Parameter Tuning** | Choose # of topics *k* | HDBSCAN clustering parameters, dimensionality reduction | Prompt templates; LLM model choice |
| **Advantages** | Proven, transparent, reproducible, lightweight | Works well for short texts; coherent topics; automatic naming | Extremely interpretable; strong for messy or domain-specific corpora |
| **Limitations** | Bag-of-words misses semantics; topics can be vague | Can struggle with very small corpora or noisy embeddings | Expensive, proprietary models, reproducibility issues |
<!-- | **When to Use** | Historical corpora, books, long articles | Tweets, abstracts, news, mixed data | When human-readable topic labels are crucial; exploratory analysis | -->

## UNL Libraries Collections

- [Digital Humanities Projects](https://cdrh.unl.edu/digital-scholarship/) \@Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH)
  - [Nebraska Newspapers](https://nebnewspapers.unl.edu/) - full-text available but needs considerable processing
  - [Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition Online](https://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/) - high-quality full-text data with comprehensive annotation
- [Notable Collections](https://libraries.unl.edu/archives-special-collections/explore-our-collections/explore-notable-collections/) \@Archives & Special Collections

## Things to Keep in Mind

- Constructing a **clean corpus** can be labor-intensive
- Topic modeling as a "tool for reading" & a way of making educated guesses
- Human reading is required
