column-a-future-educator-s-response-to-school-shootings.html,COLUMN: A future educator’s response to school shootings,2025-09-15T00:00:00-05:00,Emma Lindsey,"Every day, hundreds of thousands of people attend classes. Some are going to school for the first time - plucky preschoolers, excited to meet their teacher and peers. Others, like myself, are walking into their senior year of college, ready to meet the challenges of what their final semesters will bring.  As the excitement waned into focus during syllabus week, I woke up to the news of a school shooting in my hometown of Minneapolis, turning my focus into despair and trepidation. I watched the news unfold, the dead and injured numbers climbing and the endless debate about gun control begin anew. While this news may slowly fade in the background for some, due to some other horrific event, it won’t fade in mine.  My major is Child, Youth and Family Studies, with a focus on Inclusive Early Childhood Education; a long-winded way of saying that I am studying to become an educator of any and all children, zero to eight years old. Like any education student, I have spent hours in lectures and practicums. I’ve learned about curriculum and the subjects that my students need to learn to progress. Unlike some other education students, my major has an additional focus on the social-emotional well-being and regulation of students.  What does that have to do with the senseless gun violence in our nation’s schools? In the quiet moments, I wonder about the traumatized children who will never quite get back to that excitement of their first day. The children who are held tightly for the rest of their adolescent lives by, justly, terrified parents. The teacher who barely escaped.  In observation of smiling children with their parents, I find the creeping thought of the families that lost their children only a week, a year or a decade ago settles. I wonder about the teachers and other professionals in schools around the United States. Are they safe today? Will they be alive in a week, a month or a year? Will I be?  While many of my peers worry about their future career, where they will be working and whether they’ll like their co-workers, future educators carry an extra worry along with them. Will I one day have to shield my students from a brandished weapon? Will I find myself hunkered down with twenty kindergartners, begging them to be as quiet as they can, while bullets are fired down the hall? None of us has these answers. None of us knows, yet I would bet that most education students have considered how they might react if they find themselves in these situations.  In the case of the shooting that took place on Aug. 27 in Minneapolis, the shooter’s past teacher, Sarah Reely, pointed to mental health concerns. “I am posting this to remind people that it’s a snowball effect of multiple system failures at a national level, that every murderer was once a kid in someone’s classroom who needed help, and that this issue is so much deeper and more complicated than we want to admit.”  While there are conversations to be had about gun control and endless debates about why someone would choose to enact such violence, there is an overarching problem that remains true in our country: the mental health of our children is not held paramount to our systems or our government. This is a systematic issue, not an individual one.  One in six children faces a mental condition, while only half of those children get the help that they need. Further, only 15% of students aged 12-17 report receiving mental health services at their schools, despite a growing need for support. With administration from a local to national level concerned more about how our students compare academically to those of other countries, children continue to lose their lives to gun violence at an alarming rate. In fact, children and teens are more likely to die of gun violence than of any other cause. This has only increased in severity in recent years.  I don’t have the solution to these issues. I don’t think there is one answer that explains why these heinous events happen. What I do know is that I experienced a need for additional mental health support during my own time in K-12 schooling. That many of my own educators and administrations failed me. Maybe yours did too.  I don’t blame the teachers, principals or administration in my school district. I blame the systems that demonize both mental illness and the brave individuals who seek support for those needs. When we finally center mental wellness in our homes, schools and country, perhaps we will start to see change. No matter where you stand on the endless debates, I think you’ll agree with me here: children deserve to live full and happy lives.  Emma Lindsey is a senior Child, Youth and Family Studies major.

column-a-guide-to-studying-abroad.html,COLUMN: A Guide to Studying Abroad,2025-03-25T00:00:00-05:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"Across the pond, I find myself on a journey with my classmates who I don’t really know. Originally, we were 15 students with one thing in common: our study abroad trip.  Over the course of spring break we spent time figuring out the London tube station and how to survive in a foreign country. By the end of the week, I found 15 new friends. From falling into the back of a bus to constantly looking the opposite way while crossing the street, this trip came with many new experiences. This is my guide to studying abroad.  Going into college many students fantasize about taking a study abroad trip. Within my first semester at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, I applied and got accepted into two programs. I was eager to explore the world and learn more about life outside of the United States, as I had never flown internationally before. I didn’t know what to expect on my study abroad trip, and when I got to class the first day of the semester, I quickly realized I knew nobody.  Studying abroad for the first time can be a terrifying experience. I wish I had someone who could tell me what to expect as I prepared for my trip. Luckily, I was able to survive this journey so that I can share my experience.  Step one, find a group and stick to it. I am a very shy person when it comes to talking out loud, so before I left for my trip I didn’t talk to anyone traveling with me.  The second I landed in London, I was on a mission to leave behind my quiet exterior. I met up with my assigned roommate and started making conversation. If I was going to spend the next week in a room with someone, I wanted to make sure I knew who I was spending my time with.  We quickly found another girl in our class who was stupid enough to befriend us. I was shocked at how close I was able to get with a few girls in such a short amount of time. Stepping outside of my comfort zone allowed me to relax and have fun with a great group of girls.  Step two, expect the unexpected. Nothing ever goes as planned when traveling. Whether experiencing delays on London’s underground subway or stumbling upon a random famous person, it is important to not let a change in plans affect the trip.  I am the type of person who needs a schedule planned out. I like knowing when things are happening and what to expect when I wake up in the morning. In London, I left behind my fear of not following a planned schedule and allowed life to guide me.  This led to some of my favorite memories. I was able to stumble upon random famous people during my trip including Kate Middleton, Fergie, possibly the king and queen and even be on a movie set. None of these events would have happened if I tried to control my schedule for the day. It is way more fun to have a relaxed time with friends than sticking to a strict schedule that doesn’t allow for any breathing room.  Step three, remember to live in the moment. I don’t travel often, so having the ability to travel through education was a great way for me to explore the world. Time flies when traveling, and it can be so easy to get caught up in everything that will happen after a trip.  I’m not saying to put off school, work or spend money irresponsibly, but it is important to remember that people only travel so much in a lifetime. When deciding whether or not to get a special souvenir or take a nap, remember that these trips go by so fast. It’s hard to say when we will be able to experience this again, so it is important to live in the moment and make the trip worthwhile.  I understand that studying abroad can be an expense that some people don’t think is worth it. It was hard leaving friends and family behind and worrying about how much money I was spending. Even with these setbacks, studying abroad has been the absolute best part of college, and if I could do it again, I would in a heartbeat.  There is nothing like the experience of being a college student living life around the world. We are only young for so long, and chances like these don’t come along often. It is important to get out into the world and experience the unknown by taking chances and stepping outside of our comfort zones. Studying abroad has been the best part of my college experience, and I highly recommend it to everyone.  Jocelynn Messersmith is a freshman journalism and broadcasting double major.

column-apply-for-it-all-even-if-you-think-you-might-not-get-it.html,COLUMN: Apply for it all: Even if you think you might not get it.,2025-10-10T00:00:00-05:00,Emma Lindsey,"With the fall semester halfway gone, students might be looking for ways to get involved or find opportunities that could bring them scholarships or prestige. However, the thought of denial or lack of experience may deter them from applying for their most coveted position or goal.  After all, doesn’t that job want the person who has worked in similar fields for five years? Doesn't the club on campus want someone who was in clubs in high school? Does that scholarship just seem too good to be true?  I’m here to tell you: If you don’t apply, you will definitely never get that call of acceptance.  It seems obvious, but many question why they should apply for a job, scholarship or other opportunities. Whether it’s a lack of experience, specific skills or not believing you are enough; I’ve heard it all. The problem is, not applying does just that: Nothing at all.  As a nontraditional student, I have lived many experiences. Over the past 10 years or so, I have applied to jobs that had requirements that I didn’t have, positions I had no experience doing and opportunities that I didn’t think I was impressive enough for.  From things like helping people with their 401(k)s to being an opinion writer at the Daily Nebraskan, I have worked a litany of jobs that required me to learn new skills. I’ve gotten positions I didn’t have high school experience doing, like president of senate at the local community college to the recent position on University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s homecoming court. I’ve gotten scholarships I was convinced I wasn’t impressive enough for. I tell you these things because we all have doubts, but those doubts should not deter you from applying.  One of the first things you should know is that you’re far more impressive than you think. The things you did in high school, in your college years, in your lifetime? Your experiences and past involvements have likely taught you something, and that is valuable.  Perhaps you’re a brand new college student who wasn’t involved in high school. I wasn’t either, but when I came to college, I looked for ways to get involved on campus. Becoming involved is as simple as thinking about what you care about, a need you see on campus or focusing on a personal interest. Most Registered Student Organizations, even ones that hold some type of ‘prestige,’ aren’t difficult to get into. Most just want to know that you care about their cause and want to be part of it.  While this is true of RSOs, I can hear someone saying, “Well, that’s great…but I can’t just waltz into an interview with that and get the job.” To that person I would say, yes and no. Also, don’t you dare let a job listing’s “requirement list” deter you. Look for what is most important to the company and think of how your skills apply to that job or can benefit the employer. In my experience, an employer is going to be far more interested in you if you’re someone who is willing to learn over someone who has a teeny bit more experience than you. A lot of skills can be learned or built upon, kindness and a willingness to grow are far more attractive qualities.  One of the best things about applying for the things you’re passionate about is that the position will likely bring you new experiences and benefit your life in some way. Whether you end up loving or hating the position, you’ll come out the other side having learned something. You may learn that you need to go all in on this particular passion, that you hated it and need to change your major, or that it was simply something new to try. At the very least, you have something to talk about for future applications. However, you could stumble upon your true passion, lifelong friends, or discover parts of yourself that you didn’t know existed.  I can see why folks don’t put themselves out there. Being turned down or blown over for an opportunity sucks. It really does. There will be jobs that say they won’t hire you, you will likely lose an election for some RSO at some point, and you might be beat out by someone else for that scholarship. I have been in all of those situations. While it often feels disappointing, and sometimes truly awful, it’s all part of the process. This can be a hard pill to swallow, but I promise that your losses will teach you things too. If you never apply, you’ll never get the position.  While the idea of being turned down for something is scary and daunting, the truth is that you’re likely more accomplished than you think you are, skills you need can be learned, and the benefits will ultimately outweigh the cons. At the end of the day, college is a time to be experimental and put yourself out there. Apply. You never know what might happen.  Emma Lindsey is a senior child, youth and family studies major.

column-being-a-young-woman-manager.html,COLUMN: Being a young woman manager,2025-01-29T00:00:00-06:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"I race around the bustling kitchen on a Friday night swinging from bar to bar as I help my employees complete orders in a timely fashion and ensure every item is perfect. From dealing with customer complaints over the phone to handling the financials, I’ve done it all. Yet, I still feel like a fraud.  I work as a manager at Davinci’s, a casual Italian restaurant. Although this title seems like an accomplishment for someone who is only 18 years old, I continue to question if I am cut out for the job.  I started with the company when I was only 15 and quickly rose through the ranks to become a shift lead within a year then later a manager. Even though I have proven my ability to work efficiently, I have been challenged since day one.  My mother was the store’s general manager at the time making my promotion seem like a case of nepotism. Even after transferring to a different location this word has followed me.  It started with the other managers calling me “nepo baby.” Since both of my parents were now working at the corporate office, it was hard to refute the claims. Management at my age is something anyone would be proud of, but as a young woman this title is my greatest obstacle.  As a manager I have struggled to gain respect from my coworkers and feel safe when I am left alone in the store. Beyond this, the extra work required has started to interfere with my life as a student.  In a role of authority, respect is required. Since most of my employees are older than me it’s hard for them to take me seriously as their boss. I don’t look or sound threatening so it’s easy for others to undermine me.  While the employees see me as a friend, the other managers see me as another employee. When something went wrong in the store I was the one put on the chopping block because I was the easiest target. When I finally stood up for myself and called out one of the older managers for constantly being on his phone, he shunned me for months.  He would trade shifts to avoid working with me and told the employees that I was psychotic. All because I expressed my disapproval of his work behaviors. I walked into work for months unable to look anyone in the eye because of how afraid I was.  Some employees also find it okay to hit on me even though it is incredibly inappropriate considering I am their boss. I am forced to sit there and laugh it off or accept the compliment and move on. These comments demonstrate that I am not given the same level of respect as the other managers.  Another challenge I face is opening and closing the store as the only person in the building. The thought of having the back door unlocked while I’m alone terrifies me. I constantly think about what would happen if someone randomly walked in. I feel defenseless.  I shouldn’t have to make a plan for what to do if someone is waiting for me when I step out of the door at 11 p.m. Everytime I close by myself I run straight for my car in fear of what happens if I don’t.  Being a manager has also started interfering with my schoolwork. The first week of the semester I worked over 30 hours while taking 18 credit hours.  As a manager I am required to be the last person to leave the store. This means if we close at 10 p.m. I have to help my employees close down the store and wait for my drivers to take all of the deliveries, even if they take an order past close. Afterwards, I do all of the bookwork for the night causing me to leave way past the time we actually close. It’s difficult to find the motivation to go home and work on assignments just to wake up and do it all again.  It should be a blessing to start in a management position at my age. It’s true that I relate to the employees and can easily bond with them. I love talking with everyone and joking around, but this makes it difficult to gain respect.  Being a manager has shaped me into who I am today and I will always be grateful for the opportunity to lead at such a young age. Facing these difficulties has helped me grow as a person, but nothing will stop me from speaking up for women like me.  Jocelynn Messersmith is a freshman journalism and broadcasting double major.

column-charlie-kirk-doesn-t-deserve-accolades.html,COLUMN: Charlie Kirk doesn’t deserve accolades,2025-09-29T00:00:00-05:00,Emma Lindsey,"Charlie Kirk, a right-wing political activist and media personality, was assassinated on Sept. 10.  Soon after, news feeds were flooded with ‘us versus them’ rhetoric, President Trump ordering flags to be lowered to half-mast for several days and an explosion of anger and grief from people around the country.  As the days bore on, so did accusations. Blame was thrown in every direction, threats materialized against both the shooter and ‘the left’ and Kirk was openly revered as a martyr or even a hero.  More recently, President Trump has declared his intention to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Kirk posthumously. There are even talks about printing Kirk’s likeness on US coins.  Kirk did not deserve the accolades he gained in life and he does not deserve these further accolades now. He was not a hero, or a true leader to all and should not have his heinous ideals whitewashed to put him in a better light. Kirk’s legacy is one of hate and misinformation.  Let me be clear: Kirk did not deserve to be assassinated. While there is evidence of some celebrating his death, while others use his death to point the finger, the killing of another human being is always a horrific act.  Kirk should be known as he was: a person who spewed hate against just about anyone who was different from him. He championed the Second Amendment by waving away the deaths of children as ‘necessary evils,’ made racist remarks about a litany of people and spoke loudly against LGBTQ+ rights and the existence of climate change.  He created lists that put professors and school board officials at risk. These lists claim to expose ‘radical’ professors, despite many of the professors on the list simply championing equity, diversity and speaking out against hate.  You are welcome to agree or disagree with these viewpoints. However, what should concern everyone is the clearly biased references and the skewing of language to leave out pertinent information on these sites. These lists continue to prove worrisome for the safety of educators in higher education and with a little research, one can find information that is not manipulated.  It was unlikely that Kirk and I agreed on many things, but I do agree that free speech is important. I agree that debate and conversations are paramount to disagreements.  However, many of his debates avoid actual conversation, focus on semantics and work to ‘beat’ the person he’s talking to. He would attack at one slight misstep, preach against higher education but then suggest certain colleges to children who came to speak with him and insulted well-spoken people when he had no real answer or, presumably, felt attacked.  Almost every video wherein Kirk was debating, he would lash out with insults, jeers or personal attacks. He would continually redirect to his personal beliefs, instead of referring to sound research or directly answering the question.  Kirk wasted moments when real opportunities arose to talk about a myriad of issues through debate. Instead, he’d get lost in the tiniest of nuances or talk over someone, unable to absorb what the other side was saying. He’d sling incorrect statements as if they were fact and interrupt those with the knowledge to retort.  Kirk was not participating in academic debates: He was pivoting in every moment toward misinformation and his own opinion and away from a consensus of any kind.  Kirk has been revered as a leader, a great debater and a hero by many. If true, he might deserve accolades like the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to stand alongside folks like Rosa Parks or Steven Spielberg. However, these accolades are reserved for people who use their lives to impact our communities and country in positive and impactful ways.  Kirk did not deserve to be assassinated and he does not deserve these high praises. Kirk’s legacy of hate and misinformation cannot be forgotten because of his heinous death. We must continue to critically engage with what he said, what he believed and what he created.  Americans must stop demeaning and devaluing each other. We must begin to have respectful and knowledgeable debates wherein we truly hear each other. Otherwise, we’ll just be arguing endlessly.  Emma Lindsey is a Child, Youth and Family Studies Major.

column-consumerism-in-america.html,COLUMN: Consumerism in America,2025-10-27T00:00:00-05:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"I love shopping. If I could describe my perfect weekend, one of the activities would definitely include shopping sprees and try-on hauls. As someone who always takes off work on Black Friday, I have started to realize how my shopping habits, like many others, have started to affect my everyday life and the lives of those around me. Like most Americans, I am a consumer.  The idea of consumerism in America skyrocketed just after WWII when American soldiers returned home to a different place from which they left. Wartime production helped pull America's economy out of the depression, where the country started to see a rise in spending power. Since jobs were plentiful and wages were higher, Americans were eager to spend their money. A consumer was praised as a patriotic citizen for contributing to the ultimate success of the American way of life. And the rest is history.  Consumerism has completely changed the way people shop, which is negatively affecting the environment and causing trendy products to have lower quality. Overconsumption also leaves individuals unsatisfied and overall promotes unhappiness.  A system of consumerism can have devastating effects on the environment. While this can be traced back to the beginning of factory systems, buying mass amounts of goods leads to more pollution, waste and carbon emissions.  Consumerism is one of the leading sources of carbon emissions, which is driving carbon-heavy processes like manufacturing and transportation. At least 45% of GHG, greenhouse gas, emissions are caused by the production of goods.  Environmental pollution has also risen with consumerism, as many manufacturing processes create toxic byproducts that can easily escape into waterways. The clothing industry alone is responsible for an estimated 20% of water pollution around the world.  Consumerism can easily motivate people to buy more products than they actually need, causing them to get rid of items in good condition, leading to a large amount of material waste. Textile production generates millions of tons of waste each year, which causes perfectly good pieces of clothing to end up in landfills. The same thing can be said for electronics, which lead to toxic waste.    The rise of consumerism has also led to a decrease in the quality of products. Since companies are trying to compete against one another, many choose to lower their prices, which means that they also have to lower the quality of the products they are selling.  Those looking for cheap options may look at Shein or Temu, which will throw coupons and sales in your face. While they seem like a great place to shop for less, the quality is often made of worse material, making the purchase feel like a mistake. These places can have rare gems that are actually pretty good quality, but overall, the cheap price tag comes with cheap material.  People who are over-consumers can often find themselves unsatisfied or unhappy because they are taking time away from things that nurture happiness, such as relationships. These people have a higher tendency to compulsively spend and are at higher risk of mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.  Although consumerism has a negative effect on the environment and on personal mental health, market-driven consumption can benefit the economy. The consumption of goods boosts the country’s GDP, making it an effective way to steer towards economic growth. The rise of consumerism also means more jobs are available because there is more demand for products.  While consuming new items can be fun and good for the economy, it is important to remember the bigger effects that consumerism has on the environment and on the actual quality of goods. It is always important to prioritize what is good for our health and the environment rather than a new outfit.  Jocelynn Messersmith is a sophomore journalism and broadcasting double major.

column-democrats-should-shut-the-government-down.html,COLUMN: Democrats should shut the government down,2025-09-30T00:00:00-05:00,Jackson Hatcher,"In an email sent out to students, faculty and staff yesterday, NU leadership warned of the possible effects of a potential government shutdown. If Senate Republicans are unable to secure at least seven Democratic votes for a continuing resolution by the end of today, September 30th, the business of the government will shut down. Federal museums will shutter, research grant payments may be paused, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed and those that aren’t won’t receive their pay.  A government shutdown occurs when Congress is unable to pass budget appropriations bills. Congress must pass 12 of these bills each fiscal year, corresponding to particular agencies based on the subcommittee. Agencies aren’t allowed to spend funds not appropriated by Congress, so without these bills, agencies must stop all non-essential services.  As Congress has become increasingly gridlocked in recent decades, legislators have increasingly relied on continuing resolutions, which are agreements to continue funding the government under the previous budget.  The one caveat is that CR’s must receive 60 Senate votes to pass, a number neither party has reached since 2010. The need to fund the government has therefore been used by minority parties in the past to extract concessions from the majority.  The most recent government shutdown lasted 35 days between 2018 and 2019 during Trump’s first term. The GOP, in the minority at the time, wished to appropriate $5 billion for the construction of a US-Mexico border wall, a non-starter for Democrats.  This year’s squabble over a shutdown is a lot harder to summarize, unless you’re in the President’s circle. If you ask Donald Trump, Democrats are demanding a trillion dollars for things like “free healthcare for undocumented immigrants” and “transgender operations for everybody”. These claims are based on very little.  Democratic leadership, for its part, has framed this fight to be in opposition to the Republican spending bill passed earlier this year, which cut billions of dollars in healthcare spending, among other things. In a statement earlier this month, House Minority Leader Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Schumer said, “We are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.” To me, it is a vast understatement of the issues Democrats are up against in this fight.  The impunity with which the White House has acted since Trump took office this January has been remarkable. The executive branch has ignored court orders; seized powers that are constitutionally not afforded to it; shattered precedents at a breakneck pace; attacked law firms, universities and media companies; and mired Washington in some of the most brazen corruption I have ever seen.  Our Government is based on the bedrock idea of checks and balances, but the bodies that are meant to rein in the executive have largely encouraged this lawless behavior. The Supreme Court has misinterpreted the Constitution to afford Trump everything he wants.  The Republican controlled Congress is all too willing to allow this lawlessness as well, either because they’re too spineless to break from their party leader or because they agree with Trump’s authoritarian vision: pushing through the draconian and unpopular Big Beautiful Bill.  Through all of this, Democrats have been hiding in their offices, occasionally leaving to write a “strongly worded letter” or offer token opposition at the State of the Union. In a word, they have been feckless. Schumer would argue this is because they have no power, no leverage. Today, that is not the case.  Schumer has remained steadfast that a shutdown can be avoided with negotiations – a patently ridiculous assumption. Trump has no interest in negotiating as that would require ceding the power he’s taken for himself. He won’t see reason unless he’s made to see reason.  Republican leadership has claimed that a government shutdown will be owned by Democrats. But the fact of the matter is that Republicans control all branches of government. As the majority party, it is their responsibility to put forward a resolution that can get enough votes to pass. If they can’t get the required votes, they are the ones who are failing to be bipartisan.  This is not to say that a government shutdown has no downsides. I don’t want hungry people to miss out on their SNAP, WIC and medicaid benefits. I don’t want to see research grants paused, nor do I want to see federal employees furloughed or, if Trump’s threats hold water, fired.  What good is continuing to fund a government that can ignore congressionally appropriated funds, illegally fire workers, slash billions in benefits and levy taxes without congressional approval? This isn’t a government worth keeping open.  Trump, his administration, the GOP and the Supreme Court either can’t or refuse to see reason, so the solution is pretty clear to me: Democrats must drag them to reason by shutting the government down.

column-falling-for-fall-break.html,COLUMN: Falling for fall break,2025-10-15T00:00:00-05:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"Fall break is creeping up as the weather cools and the leaves change colors. Although the semester is starting to intensify, students will get just a few days off to relax and hopefully stay away from bookwork. While fall break is only a longer weekend, there are still plenty of activities to keep our minds off our classes.  UNL will have its fall break on Monday, Oct. 20, and Tuesday, Oct. 21. This means that students get four whole days to sit back and enjoy being away from campus.  Fall break is the perfect time to step away from school and enjoy the changing of seasons. Whether it’s detoxing from the internet or staying in town, there are so many things to do over our short break.  The best way to spend fall break is to go camping. Last year I went camping for the first time and it was the best way to spend my break. I was able to detox from a screen and just enjoy nature while the weather was still nice.  A pro to camping in the fall is that the weather isn’t too cold at night and isn’t too hot in the morning. This means that I could spend the whole day outside and still feel comfortable. I have also experienced fewer bugs camping in the fall than in other months. In the summer, there are so many mosquitoes that being outside can often be miserable, but in the fall, I don’t have that issue.  Camping is also a great way to deeply connect with friends. It gives everyone a chance to explore nature and just chat together because there isn’t the stress of the outside world. Even if someone isn’t interested in spending time outside in a tent, there are other ways to camp. People can always stay in RVs or cabins or even spend time glamping.  Another amazing way to spend fall break is at a pumpkin patch or haunted house. This is such a fun way to get in the festive mood and still enjoy nature. Many places near Lincoln have great fall attractions.  Vala’s pumpkin patch is the cutest fall retreat and offers so many attractions that are perfect for a day trip. The pumpkin field and apple cider scream fall vibes and it also has incredible photo opportunities.  Roca Berry Farm doubles as a pumpkin patch and a haunted house experience. I have been going to Roca ever since I was a little kid and it is so much fun spending time with friends on all the day attractions and then going through all the haunted attractions at night. I love Roca because I get out what I put in. If I allow myself to scream and have fun with friends, then the night becomes so memorable. It is the perfect place for that fall aesthetic and a great way to celebrate the horror of Halloween.  Eagle Hollow Haunts is another great way to spend fall break in a spooky way. This is a great night activity as there are many haunted attractions to go to. Eagle also offers people a great chance to unwind with friends by a fire.  If students want to stay in Lincoln over break, I recommend spending time at coffee shops with a book in hand to fully have a Gilmore Girls fall, or to go out and have a cute picnic at a park. The weather in Lincoln is supposed to be pretty nice, which will be perfect for a picnic or a walk in the park.  While fall break can also be the perfect time to catch up on school work, it is even better to give our minds a break from projects and assignments and enjoy the world outside of campus.  Don’t waste the days we have away from school focusing on class. Fall break is a chance to prioritize ourselves and have fun away from campus before locking in for the rest of the semester. It doesn't have to be the craziest weekend ever, but go out and enjoy the weather before it’s too late.  Jocelynn Messersmith is a sophomore journalism and broadcasting double major.

column-growing-apart-is-healthy.html,COLUMN: Growing apart is healthy,2025-02-13T00:00:00-06:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"From childhood to adulthood we are often taught to value our friends and treasure the relationship for as long as possible. The thought of losing friends can be painful, sometimes even shameful, but it can be the healthiest thing for personal growth. While losing friends can be a difficult experience, sometimes it's a necessary and healthy part of life.  To grow as a person it may mean leaving behind friendships that no longer align with who you want to become. Think about how much you've changed over the years; your values, interests and goals aren’t the same as they once were. The same can be said about friendships. It's natural for them to no longer fit the way they once did. Staying in such friendships may slow your progress and path to self-discovery. By embracing change you create space for new opportunities, self-discovery and relationships that reflect who you are becoming.  Not all friendships have a strong foundation. They can drain you emotionally, creating stress and sometimes affecting your self-worth. When friendships aren’t mutually beneficial it can lead to emotional exhaustion. When you surround yourself with toxic friendships and constant conflict, competition and lack of support from them can negatively affect your self-esteem and drain you mentally. Letting go isn’t about being harsh, it’s about protecting your peace and prioritizing yourself.  When you move on from old friendships it can create space for more meaningful friendships. As people grow and change, so do values, interests, priorities and goals. Because of this, relationships that once felt strong no longer fit who you are becoming.  Instead of holding onto relationships simply because of stability, letting them naturally fade can open new opportunities to meet new people who truly align with who you are. With new connections comes deeper understanding, growth and a stronger support system. Embracing changes in relationships doesn't mean that you are forgetting the past, but rather making room for friends that bring out the best in you.  Some people may believe that the history and stability of long-term friendships can keep them strong. In some cases long-term friendships can be a source of support, but sometimes holding onto a friendship because of a sense of obligation from shared memories can do more harm than good. If a relationship no longer brings you joy, support and growth, it may be time to let it go. You don't forget the past, you recognize that people change and that's ok.  Drifting apart from friends can be tough, but looking at it as a sign of growth can help ease the pain. Instead of seeing it as an ending, view it as a natural part of life. One that leads us to more authentic relationships. Friendship change isn't always easy, but it is an essential part of personal growth and can open the door to friendships that genuinely support the person you are becoming.

column-justice-brett-kavanaugh-thinks-racial-profiling-is-constitutional.html,COLUMN: Justice Brett Kavanaugh thinks racial profiling is constitutional,2025-10-10T00:00:00-05:00,Jackson Hatcher,"Your average Constitution-loving American would probably think that federal agents should not be able to detain someone based on their race or the language they’re speaking. Based on a recent Supreme Court opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh would disagree with that idea.  On July 11, in response to the class action lawsuit Noem v. Vasquez, a Los Angeles federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring federal agents from conducting immigration stops without reasonable cause.  The injunction clarifies that agents cannot solely rely on four factors: apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or having an accent, being present at a particular location and the type of work one does.  The Trump administration subsequently filed an emergency request to the Supreme Court, seeking to lift the injunction.    On Sept. 8, the Supreme Court issued their decision in the case. The Court voted 6-3 to lift the injunction, allowing immigration officials to stop individuals they suspect of being undocumented immigrants based on factors like race and occupation.  Kavanaugh penned a concurring opinion, in which he claimed, “Under this Court’s precedents… those circumstances taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”  This decision empowers federal agents to profile individuals based on their race, occupation and spoken language. It throws gas on the fire that is Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s brutal, inhumane and draconian immigration enforcement. It not only furthers the brutalization of undocumented persons, but it also erodes the rights of U.S. citizens.  In recent months, ICE has conducted workplace raids at places they suspect undocumented immigrants congregate, such as California Home Depots, Omaha meatpacking plants  and predominantly latino Chicago residential neighborhoods. But, being present at one of these locations is no real indication of one’s immigration status.  In January, three U.S. citizens, a family from Puerto Rico, were detained by ICE at a Milwaukee supermarket, under suspicion they were undocumented. What influenced this suspicion? They were speaking Spanish.  In that regard, they are not much different than 66 million other Americans who speak a language other than English at home. Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States, a fact that SCOTUS is willing to ignore if it means one can “reasonably” detain someone speaking Spanish.  There remain many unresolved questions regarding this point. Would someone speaking a non-English European language like Dutch or French constitute reasonable suspicion that they are an illegal immigrant? What about speaking English with a Canadian or Australian accent? Something tells me that wouldn’t cross the minds of most ICE agents.  It’s no secret that ICE has been detaining people based solely on apparent race, with little regard for the fact that one’s immigration status can’t be inferred from the color of their skin. It’s hardly worth clarifying, but an undocumented immigrant could be white, and a legal U.S. citizen could be Black or brown.  I’m reminded of a string of incidents from this January, where at least 15 indigenous Navajo people were swept up in immigration raids in Arizona and New Mexico. When asked to provide proof of citizenship, ICE wouldn’t accept their Tribal IDs. They were swept up because they looked a certain way in a certain place.  It begs the question, what does a U.S. citizen look like? Apparently not like a Native American.  Judging by a recent military-style raid of an apartment building in Chicago’s South Shore, a U.S. citizen doesn’t look Black, either. Every resident of the building, including children, were detained and handcuffed for hours, regardless of immigration status. According to a bystander, a majority of those detained were Black citizens.  It is important to note that people of color make up 42% of this country. Would an ICE agent ever look at a white person and doubt their citizenship status? Again, that would be hard to imagine.  In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh states “for stops of those individuals who are legally in the country, the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U.S. citizens.”  These are the words of a man who has never experienced an unlawful detainment. For the record, U.S. citizens have been detained unlawfully, and these detainments have often been lengthy. Beyond the inconvenience of being unlawfully detained, it is also humiliating. It’s humiliating to be treated like a criminal by your government simply for looking the wrong way, sounding the wrong way or working the wrong job.  Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in Noem v. Vasquez shows a complete and utter failure by the Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure.  In essence, granting a green light to racially profile individuals in the United States, robbing them of their rights and dignity. In 50 years, the decision will be seen as a stain on the Court and the Nation, as reviled as Plessy v. Ferguson or Dred Scott v. Sandford.

column-mental-health-deserves-more-than-a-month-of-attention.html,COLUMN: Mental health deserves more than a month of attention,2025-10-23T00:00:00-05:00,Sydney Greenspan,"We post and share about depression and anxiety every October. We see the Instagram stories of quotes about mental health and continue with the day. But why does the conversation stop when the month ends?  Each year, social media becomes filled with graphics, inspirational quotes and hashtags about depression. For a few weeks, everyone seems to care. People post reminders to “check on your friends,” share hotline numbers and talk about ending the stigma.  Then November arrives, and the conversation fades. The posts stop, the hashtags disappear and the silence takes over again.  Depression doesn’t work on a schedule, and neither should our awareness of it.  For millions of people, depression is not an occasional topic of conversation. It’s something people suffer with every day.  I’ve seen this in my own life. I’ve had days where simple tasks feel heavy and where reaching out for support feels like a burden. During those times, seeing a friend post a quote in October felt nice, but it was the real check-ins that really made a difference to me.  May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and October is National Depression and Mental Health Screening Month. Oct. 10 marks World Mental Health Day, which is a time dedicated to educating and advocating for a better understanding.  While these dates do serve an important purpose, they should not be the only time we care. Conversations and awareness about depression and mental health need to continue every day, not just when the calendar tells us to.  Keeping the dialogue about mental health year-round helps reduce the stigma and normalize the conversation.  When mental health becomes something we talk about openly and consistently, it helps those who are struggling feel less alone and more supported.  For someone living with depression, hearing others talk honestly about depression can be beneficial. Hearing others share their experience feels validating.  A consistent conversation also reinforces that mental health deserves the same attention as physical health.  Just as we wouldn’t wait for a certain month to take care of our bodies, we shouldn’t wait for October or May to take care of our and each other's minds.  Continuous education also plays a big role.  When we regularly talk about symptoms, coping strategies and healing, we help people understand what depression actually looks like. It’s not always visible, and it doesn’t always look like sadness.  Hearing someone share their personal story creates a sense of empathy and understanding that no infographic or quote can replicate.  And while awareness months have good intentions, they can sometimes feel performative. Posting a quote about “checking on your friends” means little if you never actually reach out.  Real awareness means taking action: checking in on people, advocating for better access to therapy and psychiatric care and noticing when someone around you might be struggling.  In my opinion, sending one sincere message that checks in with someone or lets them know you are there for them is worth far more than a thousand reposted infographics.  The most meaningful form of awareness doesn’t come from sharing. It comes from showing up.  With that being said, awareness months still hold value. They bring visibility, funding and attention to mental health that can lead to real progress.  However, that should be the beginning, not the end. Real progress happens when awareness turns into consistent actions, when we take what we see in October and apply it to every month that follows.  Mental health awareness is not a trend. It’s a commitment to compassion, understanding and openness. As October comes to an end, our attention shouldn’t. These conversations need to happen regularly, because healing doesn’t happen on a schedule and empathy shouldn’t either.  Someone is always there to listen, even if we don’t realize it.

column-my-mid-season-heisman-favorites.html,COLUMN: My Mid-Season Heisman Favorites,"4:09 pm, Sun Nov 2, 2025",Michael Tatten,"The mid-season point of the college football regular season is upon us, and it is time to take a look ahead at who the top contenders are for the Heisman trophy.  The Heisman trophy is the most prestigious individual award a player can win in the Football Bowl Subdivision.  Here are the top contenders for the award and who I think can really be the one to take the hardware home, starting with number five:  Jeremiah Smith is a Wide Receiver at Ohio State, and he is the only non-quarterback in contention for the Heisman. Smith burst onto the scene last season as one of the best receivers in FBS as a rookie. He helped carry the Buckeyes' wide receiver room to a National Championship win last year.  Smith’s sophomore campaign hasn't been as dynamic as fans expected, and his Heisman campaign is cooling down. In order for Smith to be able to take the trophy home, he will have to really pick up the pace, replicating some of his statistics from his freshman season.  The only non-quarterback who is going to be a contender for this award at this point in the season is Smith.  Marcel Reed is the starting quarterback for Texas A&M and a potential dark horse to win the Heisman. The last Heisman to come out of College Station was also a dark horse who took the SEC by storm. That man was Johnny Manziel.  Texas A&M has key wins over Notre Dame and Florida. They have big games against LSU, Missouri and Texas to finish out the year.  If Reed can continue to put up stats and lead his team to key-note wins, then he has to be really considered for the award.  Fernando Mendoza has been one of the biggest surprises in all of FBS as he is leading Indiana to one of the program's best seasons yet.  Mendoza is the third favorite to win the Heisman trophy, and his case has only gotten stronger after leading Indiana to a win over Oregon this past week.  Mendoza arguably has the best statistics out of any quarterback in college football, and Indiana has no ranked teams left on their schedule at this point, so if Mendoza were to continue putting up great stats and winning, he could absolutely be hoisting the trophy at the end of the year.  Ty Simpson is the starting quarterback for Alabama and has the second-best odds to win the Heisman trophy right now.  Alabama always plays a gauntlet of a schedule, being in the SEC. Alabama recently beat Georgia and has some difficult games left on the schedule against LSU and Oklahoma.  Ty Simpson isn't posting the best stats in FBS, but he is leading one of the top contenders for the National Championship. If Simpson can continue producing stats and wins, he will be a top contender for the trophy.  My top contender to take home the Heisman this year is Miami quarterback, Carson Beck. Beck is leading the Hurricanes in his first season with the team after transferring from Georgia last season.  Miami has beaten Notre Dame, Florida and Florida State this season. The Hurricanes' toughest opponents are behind them, and the team has a chance to go undefeated in the regular season.  If Beck were to lead the Hurricanes to an undefeated record, an ACC championship and put up top quarterback stats, then he would be the quarterback to win the Heisman.

column-my-top-5-actors-to-be-the-next-batman.html,COLUMN: My top 5 actors to be the next Batman,2025-10-13T00:00:00-05:00,Michael Tatten,"Batman is one of the most iconic characters in comic history. Over the years, Batman has been brought to the big screen in many different variations. Every time the Dark Knight is brought to the big screen, the actors always give a different spin on the character.  James Gunn, the head of the DC Universe, has rebooted the entire universe and is looking for actors to portray his heroes. Batman is one of the most important characters in the DCU, and the decision of who is playing Batman may be the most anticipated thing in the entirety of the DCU.  Here are my top five choices to play Batman in the DCU, starting with number five.  Jensen Ackles may not be the most blockbuster star on this list, but he has undeniable qualities that would make him a great Batman. One of those qualities is Ackles' voice. Ackles had voiced Batman in various animated projects and would bring a deep and gritty voice to the character. Ackles's demeanor is also a great fit for the Dark Knight. In the hit show, “The Boys,” Ackles portrays a dark and gritty anti-hero that had many fans wanting him to be the next Caped Crusader. Ackles would bring grit and experience to the table but may lack the star power to land the role.  Brandon Sklenar is also not a Hollywood A-lister, but there have been a lot of rumors that he could be next in line to don the cape. He has openly stated that it would be a dream for him to play the role. Gunn said that he wants the actor who plays Batman to be around the same age as the new face of the DCU, David Cornsweat, who plays Superman. With Sklenar being 35, he fits the bill of age with Corenswet being 32. A major reason for the Batman rumors has been Sklenar's rigorous training. Sklenar's trainer posted a picture with a very in-shape Sklenar claiming he was training him for his biggest role yet. Could this mean that Sklenar will be cast as the Batman of the DCU?  Christian Bale reprising his role as the Dark Knight is more than likely not going to happen since the DCU is looking to cast a younger actor. But if Gunn wanted to capitalize on nostalgia, there is no better way to do it than with Bale. Bale played Batman in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, a trilogy highly regarded as the best adaptation of Batman. The Dark Knight trilogy set the precedent for modern superhero storytelling. If Bale were to return as the Dark Knight, the DCU could expect the masses returning to the theatre to see it happen.  Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most well-known actors in Hollywood and has long been rumored for various superhero roles. Gyllenhaal’s versatility has landed him major roles that show why he would be a good Batman. In movies like Prisoners and Brothers, Gyllenhaal has shown his ability to show off his intensity and his wide range of emotional depth. His persona would make for a great Bruce Wayne. If Gunn were to go with Gyllenhaal as his Batman, you could expect one of the best superhero acting performances of this decade.  Robert Pattinson is atop my list to be the next DCU Batman because he is currently still playing Batman. “The Batman: Part II” is set to release in 2027 in a universe that is not connected to the DCU, even though Batman is a DC character. James Gunn should just make Robert Pattinson the Batman of the DCU. This decision would tie all the DC projects together and make it simpler to comprehend. The fact is that Robert Pattinson’s performance in “The Batman” was fantastic and a completely different adaptation of Batman than we have seen in live action before. Pattinson should be the DCU’s next Batman because “if it ain't broke, don't fix it.”  Michael Tatten is a sophomore sports media and communications and broadcasting major.

column-my-top-contenders-for-super-bowl-lx.html,COLUMN: My Top Contenders for Super Bowl LX,2025-09-04T10:15:00-05:00,By Michael Tatten,"This week, the reigning Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, are taking on the Dallas Cowboys to kick off the NFL’s 106th season.  After every offseason, which includes NFL Free Agency and the NFL Draft, everybody debates which teams have a real shot at contention for Super Bowl LX.  These are my top contenders to hoist the Lombardi trophy this season:  Philadelphia Eagles: Repeating as champions is one of the hardest things to do in sports. The Eagles’ infrastructure is one of the best in the league, led by general manager Howie Roseman. Roseman continues to draft and sign valuable players to help keep the team in contention. The Eagles have stars Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, AJ Brown and Devonta Smith on the offensive side of the ball. If these players can replicate their production from this past season, the NFC will run through Philadelphia.  Buffalo Bills: After winning the M.V.P. award, Bills quarterback Josh Allen has one thing on his mind: The Lombardi trophy. The Bills added some new talent, along with developing younger players. Buffalo consistently puts out a top 10 defense in the league and with a weaker AFC, this may finally be the Bills’ year to take the final leap.  Baltimore Ravens: With a top-five quarterback in the NFL, the Ravens should consistently be contenders for the Super Bowl. Unfortunately for them, they can't seem to get past the divisional round of the playoffs. Many people question whether they really are contenders if they can't beat the other AFC juggernauts. However, after a great draft and signing some big-time players, the Ravens are poised to compete in the AFC championship for a trip to the Super Bowl.  Green Bay Packers: This offseason, the Packers have been making a lot of noise. Just recently, the Packers traded for superstar edge rusher Micah Parsons, previously of the Dallas Cowboys. Their defense is set to be one of the best in the NFC and with quarterback Jordan Love entering his prime, he is viewed as a potential M.V.P. candidate. Green Bay may have another great quarterback set to lead them to the big game.  Los Angeles Rams: In the playoffs last season, the Rams were arguably the Eagles’ biggest test in their path to the Super Bowl. The Rams’ calling card is their defense. It is one of the best units in the NFC. Rams Head Coach Sean McVay is regarded as one of the best in the NFL. The Rams are only three years out from their LVI Super Bowl win. They are looking to go for one last run with quarterback Matthew Stafford under center. As long as the Rams stay healthy, they will be a team to watch for in the playoffs.  Detroit Lions: Replicating a 15-2 season is going to be difficult for Detroit, given that they play a gauntlet of a schedule and lost both of their highly coveted offensive and defensive coordinators. Regression is expected this year for Detroit, but with the offensive talent on their roster, the return of superstar pass rusher Aiden Hutchinson and head coach Dan Campbell leading the way, the Lions will continue to fight their way to winning their first Super Bowl.  Kansas City Chiefs: Last season, the Chiefs failed to three-peat and got embarrassed by Philadelphia in the Super Bowl. This offseason, they made additions to their offensive line, which was a major problem last year. The Chiefs are not the most talented team in the NFL, but the advantage of having Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes makes them dangerous.  Denver Broncos: Every year, there is a team that takes the next step towards contention and this year the Broncos will make that leap. Head Coach Sean Payton has been raving about his team this offseason. Quarterback Bo Nix is looking to build off of his very successful rookie campaign and lead Denver back to the playoffs. The Broncos are built in the trenches. They have a top-five offensive line unit, along with a top-five defensive unit. Denver is in a prime position to join the upper echelon of the AFC.  Tampa Bay Buccaneers: The Buccaneers are in a weak division: the NFC South. They have won the division the past four seasons and are looking to make that a fifth. Tampa Bay’s offense is one of the best units in the NFL, headlined by Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Mike Evans. Their offensive line is deemed as one of the better lines in football. About four years ago, Tom Brady led Tampa Bay to a Super Bowl. Baker Mayfield will now have the opportunity to do so in Tampa Bay.  My Pre-Season Super Bowl LX Prediction: Buffalo Bills beat the Philadelphia Eagles.  Michael Tatten is a sophomore sports media and communications and broadcasting major.

column-nba-s-top-contenders.html,COLUMN: NBA’s top contenders,2025-10-28T00:00:00-05:00,Michael Tatten,"The NBA season is officially underway, and the league feels wide open.  Across the association, we have teams that are tanking for draft picks, middle of the pack teams on the verge of the playoffs, fringe contenders with a lot to prove and then the real contenders for the Larry O’Brien trophy.  When determining which teams will be contenders, you have to consider the star power of the team, the depth of each team’s rotation, coaching and the overall infrastructure, and track record of each team.  Throughout the season, teams will reveal if they are real contenders or just hopeless pretenders, but right now, these are the teams that should be considered as beginning-of-the-season contenders:  Atlanta Hawks: The Hawks added pieces this offseason to make them fringe contenders with the addition of players like Kristaps Porzingis, Nickiel Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard. Atlanta has a star in Trae Young, but if Jalen Johnson can emerge as an all-star caliber player, Atlanta can prove itself as a contender in the East.  Cleveland Cavaliers: The Cavaliers decided to practically run back their team last year and did so because they had the best record in the East last season. Cleveland is the favorite to come out of the conference and their defensive prowess is a big reason why.  Milwaukee Bucks: Milwaukee added all-star caliber center Myles Turner in the off-season to help anchor the defense. The Bucks parted ways with Damian Lillard this past offseason, but they still have Giannis Antetokounmpo… for now. Giannis makes this team a fringe contender by himself.  New York Knicks: The Knicks are the other favorite in the East. The team will now have more time to mesh after all of the trades they have made over the past couple of seasons. Under new coach Mike Brown, the Knicks will look to return to the Eastern Conference Finals in back-to-back years.  Orlando Magic: The Magic added an all-star caliber player and sharpshooter, Desmond Bane, this offseason. Shooting is what has held back the Magic in seasons prior, but with the addition of Bane and other plus shooters on the roster, the Magic are looking to change that narrative. The growth of young stars Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner will determine how far this team can go.  Denver Nuggets: Denver made a lot of additions to their roster this season, giving them real depth that they hadn't had before. Nikola Jokic is the best player in basketball and this is potentially the best team that he has had in his career. Denver is one of the true threats in the entire association.  Golden State Warriors: Golden State has been the most winning franchise over the past decade, and the reason behind that is because of the infrastructure that Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Steve Kerr have built. The Warriors play a brand of basketball that is beautiful to watch and they hope to get one more championship for their franchise.  Houston Rockets: The Houston Rockets lost their point guard, Fred VanVleet, before the season and have a real hole at the spot. But with the addition of Kevin Durant to an already young, star-studded roster, the Rockets will look to be a threat in the West.  Los Angeles Clippers: The Clippers have had a lot of bad luck with injuries over the past few seasons, but their roster is deep and talented top to bottom. The team is headlined by Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, who will both be critical for the Clippers' success this year. The Clippers have a real opportunity to take advantage of playoff matchups and win the West.  Minnesota Timberwolves: Minnesota has been one of the best defensive teams over the past few seasons. They will need some younger players on the roster to fill some spots they lost, but with Anthony Edwards' career taking off, the Wolves will be in constant contention for years to come.  Oklahoma City Thunder: The Thunder are coming off a dominant season that capped off with winning the championship. Superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander posted one of the best individual seasons for a player in history. OKC has so much depth and is the best team in basketball with a real chance to establish a dynasty.  The teams to keep an eye on that could be potential contenders are the Boston Celtics if Jayson Tatum comes back from injury, the Dallas Mavericks when Kyrie Irving comes back and the San Antonio Spurs if Victor Wembanyama can take an MVP-level leap.  My top five contenders to win the championship this season, in this order, are the Thunder, Nuggets, Cavaliers, Timberwolves and Knicks.

column-pete-hegseth-wants-to-restore-a-warrior-ethos-what-exactly-does-that-mean.html,COLUMN: Pete Hegseth wants to restore a ‘warrior ethos’: What exactly does that mean?,2025-10-05T00:00:00-05:00,Jackson Hatcher,"In the introduction to his 2024 book, “The War on Warriors,” Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said of the US military, “Twenty years ago, the military was focused on lethality, competency and color blindness. Today, our brass are following the rest of our country off the cliff of cultural chaos and weakness.”  Hegseth has carried that worldview into his new role. Since his confirmation in January, Hegseth has consistently railed against “woke” policies, making it clear that his mission has been to restore a “warrior ethos” to the military, a nebulous and undefinable term. It begs the question, what exactly does Hegseth mean when he says he wants to restore the warrior ethos?  Hegseth joined the Army National Guard in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan and was stationed at Guantanamo Bay. For his service, he earned two Bronze Stars and a Combat Infantryman Badge.  In 2021, he was barred from serving at President Joe Biden’s inauguration after a fellow guard member sent an email to his unit’s leadership drawing attention to a chest tattoo reading “Deus Vult,” a term commonly used by white supremacists.  In his book, Hegseth characterized this incident as the army labeling him an extremist. Despite this, he would remain in his unit for several more years before resigning. This is the incident that prompted him to write “The War on Warriors.”  Hegseth was confirmed on January 24th under much controversy over his alleged alcoholism and his views on women in the military. He was confirmed on a 50-50 vote, the closest vote of any cabinet member. Since then, he has begun to rework the Pentagon in his image.  Much of what he has done has been very superficial, renaming things to be more in line with President Trump’s anti-woke and anti-DEI policies. Most notably, he urged the President to rename his department to the Department of War.  He also renamed the USNS Harvey Milk to the Oscar V. Peterson, saying “people want to be proud of the ship they’re sailing in.” This move stripped honors away from Harvey Milk, a Navy veteran as well as the first openly gay politician in California.  He also changed the newly named Fort Liberty in North Carolina and Fort Moore in Georgia back to their original names from before the Biden administration – Fort Bragg and Benning, respectively. If you were somehow unaware, Braxton Bragg and Henry Benning were both Generals of an enemy nation – insurrectionists to the republic, who were partly responsible for the deaths of 360,000 American service members.  In a speech to the military’s top brass delivered on September 30th, Hegseth said, “People make honest mistakes, and our mistakes should not define an entire career.” The worst example of a mistake made by a military official, Hegseth thinks, that can be swept under the rug is the 1890 massacre of Wounded Knee.  The massacre is notorious, seen as one of the darkest, most unjustifiable stains on American history. Upwards of 250 innocent Lakota Sioux men, women, and children were gunned down by US soldiers. Twenty soldiers who took part in the massacre were posthumously stripped of their Medals of Honor by Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd Austin.  This month, Hegseth announced the reversal of that decision, restoring their stripped metals, calling those who committed the massacre “brave.”  His speech also touched on new standards at the Pentagon. Chief among them being returning to, in his words, “the highest male standard only.” Stating that overweight men, as well as women who don’t live up to whatever Hegseth determines is the highest male standard, are not welcome in the military. He has also attacked transgender people, implementing Trump’s proposed ban on transgender individuals serving in the military.  He has also implemented harsher grooming standards, stating in his speech, “no more beardos.” The military has always had strict grooming standards, but there have been exemptions in the past. For example, Sikh men, who are primarily Punjabi Indian, do not shave for religious reasons. There have also been medical exemptions for soldiers who suffer from conditions like Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, a condition where shaved hairs curve backward into the skin, causing irritation. This condition primarily affects Black men.  It’s clear that all of this isn’t about creating a military dedicated to “lethality, competency and color blindness.” To me, it is plain and simple what Hegseth means when he says he wants to restore a warrior ethos to the Military. It means desecrating the legacy of gay soldiers. It means honoring traitors to the country. It means rewarding massacres of women and children. It means a military where women, transgender people, and minorities aren’t welcome. That’s no military we should ever be proud of.

column-rejection-by-thousands-lessons-from-dan-osborn-s-campaign.html,COLUMN: Rejection by thousands: Lessons from Dan Osborn’s campaign,2024-11-21T00:00:00-06:00,Bret Fulton,"Election night is always full of excitement or shocking devastation and this past cycle certainly did not disappoint. However, working on Dan Osborn’s independent U.S. Senate campaign amplified these feelings of uncertainty knowing that my future and the future of our state was determined by hundreds of thousands of votes. Osborn’s loss taught me valuable lessons that I will continue to carry with me for the rest of my life.  I started working on Osborn’s campaign in June 2024. At that point, only one poll showed him tied with incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer and national media had yet to pick up on the race.  What I originally assumed would be another losing campaign quickly transformed into an operation that had a real chance of challenging Nebraska’s political establishment. Instead of losing by over 20 points in a statewide general election like democrats in 2018, Osborn would lose by only seven. His race forced national republicans to buy millions of dollars worth of advertisements to defend Fischer’s seat.  Politics was a central part of my life growing up. Some of my earliest memories are going into the voting booth with my dad as he casted his ballot in the 2008 Presidential Election. I still remember seeing Obama’s face all over the news in my early childhood and the passion he brought to politics.  This early exposure made me politically active all throughout high school and college. When I was given the opportunity to intern for an, at the time, obscure U.S. Senate candidate there was nothing I could say other than yes. Knocking on doors, sending thousands of annoying election texts and working out of a bare office space with other students taught me the humble beginnings of a fierce campaign.  Working so hard for something I believed to be rejected by 63,000 votes was a hard pill to swallow, however, this grew my faith in our election process. Osborn’s concession speech before a line of cameras and news reporters quelled the anxieties of myself and his supporters. He reaffirmed to me that concession is the foundation of a healthy democratic system.  Running for any office is like a months-, sometimes years-, long job interview where your boss is the millions of voters who will ultimately make the hiring decision. While losing crushed the hopes of thousands of Nebraskans, I am still just as resolved in the promise of an independent challenge to a long held Republican seat that I felt was not doing enough to help out everyday people.  Many who woke up disappointed the morning after election day questioned where we go from here. Some have taken the time to make unfounded claims about election fraud or cling to false hope in recounts. However, I saw firsthand the power that knocking on doors and offering a resonating message can have. Every mass movement for an issue or a candidate has these simple origins.  Campaigning for Osborn exposed me to the hard work that comes with living in a system like ours. Any massive change takes a lot of work, resources and convincing, especially running as an independent. This campaign showed me that offering a message that everyday voters connect with is an extremely powerful tool.  This campaign exposed the value of a losing campaign. When Sen. Fischer should have won an easy re-election by double digits, she instead only won by seven. In a race that attracted national headlines and siphoned millions of dollars away from republicans in more competitive senate races, it is safe to say this campaign still made its mark in sending a message to absent politicians.

column-the-cost-of-staying-quiet.html,COLUMN: The cost of staying quiet,"3:38 pm, Thu Oct 30, 2025",Dawson Iasillo,"In an era when shouting often drowns out substance, many who oppose the Trump administration have stepped back, opting for caution over confrontation. It’s understandable. Protests can feel risky, debates can turn hostile and the internet rarely forgives mistakes.  But staying silent doesn’t make the danger go away; it deepens it. Real change has never come from quiet agreement. Throughout history, progress has always come from courage, visibility and persistence.  In the recent months of the second term of the Trump administration, I’ve seen firsthand how people have started retreating into their shells, growing quieter as tensions rise. Covering political events as a journalist, I’ve been turned down for interviews more often than ever before. When I ask people to share their perspectives, the answer I hear most frequently is some version of, “I’m too scared.” Too scared to speak publicly. Too scared to protest. Too scared to be labeled, attacked or doxxed online.  As a female journalist working in a time of turmoil, I know the risks. I’ve received hateful comments, threats and personal attacks just for doing my job. There are moments when I’m nervous, when I hesitate before publishing a story or walking into a protest. But I do it anyway, because the stakes are too high not to.  These fears are valid, but they can’t be the end of the story. Fear doesn’t disappear when we avoid it; it just grows stronger. The hard truth is, it’s time to be scared, because democracy doesn’t survive on silence; it survives on participation. Authoritarianism is fueled by silence and complacency.  There is no longer room for excuses. Every time people in opposition stay quiet to avoid discomfort, the forces of authoritarianism grow louder and bolder. We cannot keep retreating while democracy crumbles in real time. If the people who claim to value equality, freedom and justice are too afraid to stand up for them, then those ideals will be erased by those who aren’t afraid to destroy them.  The reality is, what people are doing now is not enough. There are too many people watching from the sidelines. No change will happen until we unite for change, even through the bouts of anxiety it might bring.  History books will not be written about those who posted something on their story or stayed at home during a protest. They will not speak about those who complained behind closed doors but were too afraid to speak in public. They will not speak about those who sat back, watched and shook their head.  Who will you be in the history books?  Protesting can be scary. Speaking out can be nerve wracking. But what is even scarier is democracy crumbling, families being ripped apart and America as we know it dying.  Saying that liberals are an embarrassment right now may sound harsh, but what’s truly shameful is the silence. History will not remember our fear. It will remember our failure to act.  So speak out. Protest. Write. Vote. Shout from the rooftops if you have to. Because if we don’t, someone else will, and their version of America won’t include us.

column-the-mind-of-a-woman-in-america.html,COLUMN: The mind of a woman in America,2024-11-12T00:00:00-06:00,Dawson Iasillo,"Little girls sit around the TV for months waiting to watch someone like them be elected as the President of the United States. Elderly women sit patiently waiting to see all of their hard work toward equality pay off. People are excited. People are hopeful. For the first time ever it feels like a woman is the only option.  On election night, state by state gets called. Passion diminishes as each vote is given to former president, Donald Trump. Soon, being a woman in America feels hopeless. The unsettling feeling of a power-hungry man being in control of our future sinks in. Reality feels gloomy and dark. Patriarchy won again, despite all of the efforts and strides we have made.  The line has been drawn: being a woman is a higher crime than a convicted felon who is a man.  Women now have an invisible string tying them to one another in solidarity. They bond over the grief and uncertainty of what is to come in their futures that lie in someone else’s hands.  This election could have shown little girls that they can grow up to be anything they want to be. Instead, this election demonstrated that no matter how hard a woman works, a lazy man can always beat them out. It showed boys that they can still be the leader of America after sexually abusing women, committing fraud and lying their way through life.  Leaders of countries, especially America, influence people. In the past week alone, women have seen men degrading and belittling them to no end. Men chant, “Your body, my choice” and remind women that the glass ceiling is nothing that can ever be broken.  For years, Trump made it acceptable to talk about women in this sense. The misogynistic quotes from Trump seem to be a never-ending cycle as they inspire men to be just like their president. It is nothing short of exhausting watching this man continue to spew hatred while being held at such low standards with no accountability.  I am a woman in politics. I work hard for my future. Every day, I choose to use this passion of mine to strive for greatness and to be the change in the world, even if it is on a small scale. I am more than aware of the threats made toward women by the Trump administration and Project 25. It is an understatement to say how horrifying it is to come to the realization that all the progress we have made in women’s rights may be thrown out the window. From my standpoint, it shatters my heart. I question what I am even working hard for if it will all be for nothing in the end.  I see how hard Kamala Harris and how little Donald Trump have worked in their lifetimes. With Harris’ resume, there is no doubt that she was one of the most qualified candidates to run for the presidency. Yet, her unbelievable campaign, her policy plans and her successes so far still were not enough to prove to America that a woman can be in charge.  I want my hard work to pay off, the same way Harris did. Seeing the disappointment in the country is such a disheartening feeling to witness.  Despite all of the pain that I and millions of other American women felt this week, I am joyous. I am happy to be on the right side of history. I do not understand how someone could support a human being with the character of Trump, but I am grateful that I do not understand. I am thankful that my heart is big enough to choose human rights over the price of eggs. I am pleased with my anger after the election results because that is living proof that I am full of empathy and passion. I love politics a lot, but there is nothing I love more than being a woman, regardless of how much it hurts sometimes.  I know all too well that I am not alone in these feelings of uncertainty and fear. I also know women are not the only ones settling into their distress. However, as Harris said, “It is time to roll up your sleeves.” Women cannot throw in the towel and give up after how much work their grandmothers put into women’s rights. The glass ceiling is dying to be broken, so be the woman to break the ceiling. On the good days and the bad days, it is always empowering and such an honor to be a woman.

column-top-5-picks-to-host-the-2026-oscars.html,COLUMN: Top 5 Picks to Host the 2026 Oscars,2025-03-10T00:00:00-05:00,Michael Tatten,"The 2025 Oscars aired last week, marking the 97th Academy Awards ceremony. The Oscars have awarded excellence and achievements in the film industry since 1929. It is a highly esteemed awards show. This year’s show drew 19.7 million viewers, setting a new high out of the last five years.  Every year the Oscars are judged on how successful the show was based on factors like how long the show ran or if the winners were more deserving than others. However, the ultimate test of a successful Oscars award season is largely based on the host of the night.  A good host is essential for a successful show. The host must engage the audience, make jokes, transition between awards, present comedic bits, keep the show moving and handle any unexpected moments all within a three-hour time frame.  There has been talk about who the 2026 Oscars host could be, and while there are plenty of viable options, five candidates stand out to me.  A realistic option to host the 2026 Oscars is comedian Conan O’Brien, who hosted the 2025 awards. It is widely believed and reviewed that O’Brien had a terrific Oscars hosting debut. O’Brien threw in some edgy jokes that paralleled current headlines in the news, set a great pace for the show in between awards and kept the people entertained. O’Brien’s past entertainment show hosting experiences made him a qualified pick for the 2025 Oscars. With him nailing his performance, the Academy would certainly be happy to have him back to host next year’s Oscars. Realistic Rating: 10/10  Coming off a very successful outing as the first solo female host of the Golden Globes, Nikki Glaser would be a red-hot selection to host the 2026 Oscars. Glaser is an actress, stand-up comedian and television host who gained mass popularity after her bit at the Tom Brady Roast. Glaser herself stated that the Tom Brady Roast “changed my life forever.” Glaser’s stardom is only beginning, and she will be looking to keep that momentum going. If the Academy chooses Glaser as the 2026 host, it would be a wild show with unhinged jokes, making it one of the more entertaining Oscars in recent times. Realistic Rating: 8/10  Widely regarded as one of the funniest people on the planet, Adam Sandler would absolutely deliver an entertaining three hours of television. Sandler can relate to all generations, which would bring in more viewers for the Academy. Sandler is starring in “Happy Gilmore 2,” a film that will be released in July 2025. This film will look to connect generations and be a highly relevant and comedic film. The real question is if Sandler would do it. Sandler has never won an Oscar, so perhaps he wants to find his Oscar success as the 2026 host. Realistic Rating: 6/10  Maybe a more unrealistic option to host the 2026 award show, but my personal choice is Pete Davidson and Shane Gillis. Davidson and Gillis are both stand-up comedians who have great comedic chemistry and would make for hilarious hosts. Gillis has appeared on Davidson’s show, “Bupkis”, they were both in Eminem’s music video for his song, “Houdini”, and both have multiple appearances on the show, “Saturday Night Live”. If this duo were to host the 2026 Oscars, it would make for, in my opinion, the best Oscars ever. Realistic Rating: 4/10  Potentially another co-host option for the Academy to consider would be Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Fey and Poehler are both actresses and comedians. The duo have been friends for more than30 years. This comedic duo found great success as the hosts of the Weekend Update on “Saturday Night Live” with their amazing chemistry and quippy writing abilities for jokes, skits and characters on SNL. Fey and Poehler have hosted the Golden Globes four times, and every show was deemed a hilarious success. The duo has also made numerous films, including the hits like “Mean Girls” and ""Baby Mama.” They both have a decorated background hosting the Golden Globes and “Saturday Night Live”, which would make them prime candidates to host the 2026 Oscars. Realistic Rating: 6/10  Critics may not appreciate these picks as much as I would. All of these hosts would make some either edgy, awkward or out-of-pocket jokes, and perhaps the Academy wants to go with a more conservative, traditional host. The Oscars have done ceremonies with no hosts as well, so that is potentially a route that they want to take. However, the Oscars with no hosts were rated as the worst Oscars of all time, and part of the reason they are trending back to relevancy is due to the fact that there is a charismatic host at the helm.  The Oscars are heading back in the right direction and the Academy has many candidates to choose from that will give them a successful 2026 Oscars award show.",2025-03-10T05:00:00Z,2025,3,2025-03,COLUMN,OPINION
column-when-it-comes-to-big-coffee-who-reigns-supreme.html,"COLUMN: When it comes to ‘big coffee,’ who reigns supreme?",2025-11-03T00:00:00-06:00,Emma Lindsey,"In Lincoln, there are options abound for a coffee drinker. Whether you prefer to pick up a cup of joe from a local dive or a large chain, there are options for everyone. As a self-identified coffee connoisseur, I have tried coffee from all over the United States.  My first job was as a barista, which proved dangerous, as I now struggle to stomach terrible coffee. Perhaps more discerning is my taste for espresso. As a coffee drinker, I want to be able to taste the espresso intermingled with milk and flavorings. This brings me to the pursuit of finding the best coffee among the four powerhouses of ‘big coffee’ chains in town.  I tried coffee from Starbucks, Scooters, 7 Brew and Dunkin’. From each establishment, I ordered a small hot skim milk caramel latte. I’ll also be ordering around the same time of day and in similar-esq locations.  I will rate each on taste, speed and quality of service and price. Speed is included because this is often why most folks choose to purchase from a chain. For each element, I will rate it on a 1-5 scale. With this, let’s start with the powerhouse that is Starbucks.  Starbucks is a household name. They are seemingly everywhere and loved by thousands of people.  I ordered from Starbucks around 2 p.m. on Monday. There was no line and service was quick: I spent only a minute and forty seconds there. While it was a quick interaction, it was far from a warm one. The employee was monotone and didn’t engage in anything other than the necessities. The flavoring tasted a bit too fake or light and the flavor of the espresso seemed to hide behind the taste of the milk. I prefer a more robust flavor in the espresso and a richer flavoring to the caramel. The hot and small drink was 12-oz, which I paid $5.74 for.  Quality of service: 2, Speed of service: 5, Taste: 2, Price/Value: 3. Overall score: 2.4.  Dunkin', another well-known coffee chain, is also far-reaching. Known as a cheaper option, folks often turn to Dunkin’ for their caffeine fix.  I visited Dunkin’ on Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. Again, there was no line present, and I spent two minutes and eight seconds there. The employees there seemed focused on doing the job and moving on to the next customer. They weren’t overly warm, but not unkind or monotone in their approach. Though the coffee was at a reasonable temperature, the taste was off. Upon first sip, I sensed some kind of dish soap taste. I took two more sips of the coffee before ultimately throwing it away. I couldn’t taste anything other than the taste of soap. The coffee wasn’t drinkable. I paid $4.80 for the 10-oz cup.  Quality of service: 2.5, Speed of service: 3, Taste: 1, Price/Value: 1. Overall score: 1.9.  Scooter’s is a popular option here in Nebraska. Known for their sweet coffee and their famous “go ahead and scoot around” line, Scooter’s is well-loved.  I visited Scooter’s on Wednesday at around 2 p.m. Once more, there was no line, and I spent about one minute and 48 seconds. The employees at Scooter’s proved once more to be kind and helpful. They cracked a few jokes, asked me how I was and offered a drink stopper. They didn’t keep me too long, but they were conversational. The coffee was similar to the Starbucks latte I tried earlier in the week, but was far more robust in flavor. The caramel and espresso tasted richer. I paid $6.18 for my 12-oz cup.  Quality of service: 4, Speed of service: 5, Taste: 4, Price/Value: 1. Overall score: 3.5.  7 Brew was my last visit. Upon my first attempt, a friend was working, and I came back midday Saturday. I spent a little over eight minutes in line, but only one minute and a half until my order was taken. There were around eight other cars in front of me. I paid $4.76 for a 12-oz cup. The taste of the latte is what I expect from 7 Brew, rich in flavor and caramel, but not overpowering. The service was kind and conversational, asking me about my day and confirming my order. The employee wished me well before I drove away to enjoy my cup.  Quality of service: 5, Speed of service: 3.5, Taste: 5, Price/Value: 5. Overall score: 4.6.  I argue 7 Brew is the best out of these four large coffee chains. Their quality and speed of service are consistent, the coffee is delicious and it is reasonably priced! However, I know there are some incredible local coffee dives in town. Any suggestions?    Emma Lindsey is a Child, Youth and Family Studies major.

column-winter-is-the-best-season.html,COLUMN: Winter is the best season,2024-11-20T00:00:00-06:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"There's a certain magic in the way the air turns crisp and the first snowflakes begin to fall. However, winter is a season that often gets a bad reputation. Some say it's too cold and the sun sets too early, but few embrace it as more than a season, but a feeling. From fun traditions to the beauty of a landscape covered in a fresh dusting of snow, winter is by far the most beautiful and underrated season of the year.  Winter is a season full of blankets, cozying up by a fireplace, comfort TV shows and a warm drink. There's something so comforting about being warm inside while the snow falls and the world becomes frozen in time. There’s a sense of tranquility walking through the trees covered with snow, icicles hanging from their branches. Parks, cities and forests become magical with the snow muffling the noise of daily life.  Along with the serenity of winter, the activities are simply unmatched. With skiing, sledding, snowball fights, ice skating and more, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Some of my favorite memories I’ve made are being launched in the air off a sled, or rolling down a hill while learning to ski. There is something so special about coming inside from playing out in the cold. Laying out my wet shoes with a cold nose as I warm up beside the fire is an ideal afternoon.  While the beauty and activities of winter are fun, my favorite part is the connection winter brings. The home-cooked food, nostalgic desserts and Black Friday deals get the holiday spirit started. Being able to go home for Thanksgiving break and see family and friends is an unbeatable feeling. Sitting beside a decorated tree while exchanging gifts with loved ones are what bring the magic of Christmas alive. Then there's the anticipation for the New Year, a celebration of fresh starts and goal-making. It reminds us that winter isn't just an end, but also a beginning.  Winter celebrations bring people together, as they are drawn to the season of giving. Houses shine with lights and towns host festival events creating a sense of community. In a season that is often cold, these celebrations are like pockets of warmth.  While some may complain about the icy mornings and early sunsets, I am personally looking forward to the slow, cozy mornings. It invites us to slow down, connect with each other and find the beauty in the stillness. Winter is a reminder that even on the coldest days we can find solace in the warmth of our homes, family and communities.  Hannah Nazarenus is a junior journalism and ADPR double major.

column-your-mental-health-is-more-important-than-a-college-degree.html,COLUMN: Your mental health is more important than a college degree,2025-10-27T00:00:00-05:00,Emma Lindsey,"Between college classes, jobs and personal commitments, most college students might find themselves without the time necessary for their mental wellness. While these various endeavors may be important and valuable to one’s life, I will be the first to tell you that your mental health is the one thing that you can’t forgo for long.  To put my understanding into perspective, I am currently a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I’ll also be turning 30 in March. While not always true, I am often the oldest undergraduate student in my classrooms. The reality is that when I was what most people would consider ‘college-aged,’ I was working meaningless jobs and was uninterested in ever returning to college.  See, much like my peers, I went to college immediately after high school. Despite having the sneaking suspicion that it was the right thing at the wrong time, I registered for my first semester. I went to classes, joined study groups and attempted to feel at home in a place that I just wasn’t ready for.  This became more evident as I began to fail my classes. Subjects I was often adept at fell into barely passing, while classes I struggled with only slipped into a failing grade. I stopped going to classes, didn’t ask for help and was swallowed by shame. I figured I just wasn’t cut out for college.  However, after being in the workforce for years, I suffered a mental breakdown. The mental illness I had ignored and had left unmedicated finally grew unmanageable. It refused to be ignored any longer and my life came crashing down.  While this time in my life was frightening, filled with difficult healing and required that I seek help from my community, I did make it out to the other side. From this, I have learned that nothing is worth the disintegration of your mental health.  You, or the people in your life, might think that dropping out of college is the worst thing that can happen. Perhaps failing a class or, even worse, being put on suspension in college is the scariest thing that could happen. Maybe you’re reading this right now and thinking that you can just keep toughing it out, that you don’t need help or that it might be weak to seek it.  I don’t want to scare you, but there are worse things than failing a class, being put on suspension or dropping out of college. I know because I have been there. I tried to tough it out, to struggle through it and to make people proud by continuing college. I worked myself to exhaustion, trying to keep my illness-ridden brain focused and on task, if only to prove I could ‘pull myself up by my bootstraps.’  I dropped out of college with less than a 1.0 cumulative GPA, but what was far worse was the deterioration of my mental health.  However, there is light at the end of this tunnel. It took years of work, of sacrifice and not just asking for help, but taking it. When I took my mental health seriously and made time for myself, I was able to pursue college again. I was able to flourish and do more than just go to classes, something I never saw as a possibility during my first attempt.  None of this would have been possible without taking a step back to care for myself. I shudder to consider what could have happened if I continued to ignore or shy away from what my body and brain were telling me I needed.  So, if your brain is telling you that it has had enough, there are resources on campus that you can turn to. You don’t have to drop out of college or fall into shame – but you should seek help. Perhaps that includes therapy, medication or lightening your class load. Maybe you’re in the same position I was in, and dropping out is the best solution for you at this point.  No matter where you are in your journey, you should know that it’s okay to choose yourself. It’s okay to put your mental health first. It’s okay to stand boldly and do what is best for your needs and choose the path and timeline that work best for you.  If no one else is, I am proud of you for making the decisions you need to protect your mental health and make space for your needs. You are worth more than a college degree, a job or an extra commitment. Those things can wait, but your wellness can’t.  Emma Lindsey is a senior Child, Youth and Family Studies major.

conference-realignment-is-a-mess.html,OPINION: The Upside of a Messy Conference Realignment,2024-10-07T00:00:00-05:00,Jalen-Thomas Kroger,"The landscape of college football remained relatively stable with not much changing in the way of conferences for most of its lifetime.  Five major conferences had majority control over the sport, being labeled as the Power Five conferences. They are the Big Ten, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), the Pac-12, the Big 12 and the Southeastern Conference (SEC).    In the past couple of years, many schools switched from their long-established conferences in favor of moving to new territory. The reason teams jump ship to new competition is for one reason: the almighty dollar.  Teams get compensated by television networks to broadcast their games. Most of these television games are organized by conferences, or conferences have their own television networks.  When these conferences’ leases are finished with their networks, schools can find new conferences that will pay them just as much, or even more, to play for them on their television stage.  In August, the Pac-12 conference, the only Power Five conference yet to negotiate a new TV deal, was left with two teams remaining in their conference, with the other 10 teams moving to compete in other conferences.    Money talks for those willing to listen, and many other teams in collegiate sports were open to trade in legacy and history for new contracts.  In the past two years, 27 teams have transferred conferences, completely shaking up the landscape.  One of the main complaints of the new realignment is the dissolution of long-established rivalries from within the conferences, but this is not a bad thing.  The death of tradition and history, especially tradition built on mutual hate, pride and trash-talking, leads to rebirth in new situations.  New teams in new conferences allow new rivalries to be built, even though they take time to develop. Rivalries don’t spawn out of nowhere, so developing them will take time, but that’s what’s special about them.  Most rivalries started before many modern college football fans were even born, but now we have the opportunity to watch new ones develop.  College football is an evolving sport, despite its age, so things like conference realignment are bound to happen.  Not all conferences started with the teams they had before the recent realignment shakeup, there was plenty of realignment beforehand.  Although the unprecedented recent realignment moved many teams and shifted conferences geographically, this is just what happens in this sport. Teams were bound to move, and it just so happened that it was all very recently.  The many critics of the recent realignment act like this is the end of the sport, but this new realignment will work out, like it has with every realignment prior to the past two years.  Even if conference realignment is a mess right now, that does not mean that it will remain this way in the coming years. Teams and fans will eventually get used to their new in-conference opponents and learn to accept them as a competitor.  While it’s strange to see UCLA, USC, Oregon and Washington in the Big Ten, fans should be rejoicing at the sight of new competition in a conference that was only dominated in recent years by Ohio State and Michigan.  Even though conference realignment will work out, that doesn’t negate the mess it currently is. Many despise the new additions to their conference and the teams that left their old conference. However, schools aren’t realigning for fans. Fans should focus on the fact that new realignment provides opportunities to college football, even if this progression in the game has its growing pains.  The best thing to do as a college football fan is to enjoy what the game is bringing in ways of new development.  It’s time to enjoy realignment rather than try to poke holes in its fundamentality, because this is a new chapter for college football that should be observed instead of complained about.

cure-to-male-loneliness.html,COLUMN: The cure to male loneliness,2024-10-28T00:00:00-05:00,Jalen-Thomas Kroger,"In July 2023, pictures of the same painting of a crying man watching people play pickleball filled Twitter, now known as X.  The picture originates from an opinion article written by Michelle Cottle and published in The New York Times about the “cure” for male loneliness.  The article, titled “Is the Cure to Male Loneliness Out on the Pickleball Court,” details how the rise of male loneliness can be fought with hobbies.  Male loneliness is a serious problem here in America, but it’s often overlooked.  A 2023 State of American Men report found that two-thirds of surveyed men between ages 18 and 23 say, “no one really knows me.” Not only this, but since 1990, the share of men who lack a single close friend quintupled to 15%.  So what can be done about male loneliness? Is there a cure, and is it actually pickleball? No.  Cottle’s article is a double-edged sword when it comes to male loneliness because, while it brings attention to the issue, it’s tone-deaf. Men’s general mental health has always been neglected, but it’s not because of a lack of pickleball.  Opening up about mental health is challenging, but it seems to be even harder for men. Whether it’s because of toxic environments or the standards and expectations ingrained in our society, men often have a harder time opening up. Without opening up about their feelings, men struggle to build relationships with their friends and end up becoming part of the statistics mentioned earlier.  Part of the reason men don’t open up can be seen in the response to Cottle’s article, which turned into a joke.  The article lays out good points about how group hobbies can be very beneficial to lonely men, but few readers paid attention to that. This opinion piece was meant to be serious, but with a questionable title and outlandish art, the story was turned into a huge joke.  Few people took the substance of the piece seriously, rather poking fun at how dumb the notion of pickleball curing male loneliness is.  Men can’t open up about their feelings when the response could easily be met with jokes made in poor taste. The mental health struggles of men can’t even be taken seriously enough by men before it gets mocked.  It’s easy to blame the people making the jokes, but can you really blame them for making fun of this article? Pickleball curing male loneliness is a preposterous idea, and publishing it with full certainty makes it very vulnerable to criticism.  An article like this makes a mockery of the epidemic-like rise of male loneliness in America and does the opposite of what it was intended for. Attention is brought to the subject, but it comes with the side effect of making that exact subject susceptible to the things that take attention away from it.  So, what is the cure for male loneliness? It depends. Like the article says, it can be through hobbies with other men that bring them closer together, but for others the cure is totally different.  Above all, the cure for male loneliness is making it easier for lonely men to open up about how they feel. This can be through therapy, support groups or other men.  Opening up can provide solace and relatability for men, creating a tighter bond within their individual relationships.  There is no cure for male loneliness, but we can take steps to make it less of an issue in America, and it starts with talking about the issue.

editorial-censorship-of-indiana-daily-student-is-inexcusable.html,EDITORIAL: Censorship of Indiana Daily Student is inexcusable,2025-10-23T00:00:00-05:00,The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board,"One thing most Americans can agree on is that censorship of the media does not belong in this country. However, the University of Indiana’s Media School is in the midst of committing a blatant act of censorship against the Indiana Daily Student, the school’s student publication.  On Oct. 14, IDS co-editors-in-chief Mia Hilkowitz and Andrew Miller said they were sent an email from IU Media School Dean David Tolchinsky. In the email, Tolchinsky explained to Hilkowitz and Miller that the IDS would be forced to shift from print to digital platforms that week to combat the paper’s growing deficit.  This email came just hours after former IU Student Media Director Jim Rodenbush was called into an urgent meeting with Tolchinsky and promptly fired. According to his letter of termination, Rodenbush was let go for his “lack of leadership and ability to work in alignment with the University's direction for the Student Media Plan.”  The university’s “direction” was censorship.  In recent months, the IDS and university leadership have been at odds over what the paper publishes. Since the IDS was forced to move from a weekly publication to seven themed special editions per semester in the spring of 2025 as a budget-cutting measure, university leadership pushed for the paper to keep news stories out of the print editions.  After the release of the IDS’ Sept. 10 edition, Media School Associate Dean Galen Clavio called Rodenbush into a meeting, where he asked Rodenbush why the publication still had news stories in print.  In other words, Clavio was asking why a newspaper was printing the news.  Later that month, ahead of the IDS’ next publication, Clavio continued to push the newspaper to take its general news coverage out of the edition. Rodenbush pushed back, saying that restricting a paper’s freedom to publish what it desires is the “definition of censorship.” On Oct. 7, Rodenbush relayed to his students that the university expected the next edition to focus solely on the theme of homecoming.  On Oct. 13, Hilkowitz and Miller emailed Tolchinsky, Clavio and other university leadership, pleading with them to take back their decision. Hilkowitz and Miller argued the directive infringed on their right to free speech, and suddenly cutting the print edition would interfere with advertiser relations.  If the decision to cut print was solely fiscal, then why would university leadership make such a sudden move that could grow the paper’s deficit even more? It’s because the IU Media School would rather double down than realize the error of its ways.  Tolchinsky’s attempt to paint his attempt at censorship as a business decision is inexcusable.  The IDS’ budget deficit is something that needed to be addressed, but after agreeing to take on the publications’ deficit in the 2021-22 fiscal year for three years, the media school only met with the IDS once over the two years. During that time, the deficit neared $500,000.  The silver lining to the situation is that the IDS handled it gracefully. Although they couldn’t get it to newsstands, the IDS published their Oct. 16 edition online with the front headline reading “CENSORED” in bold red font, accompanied by a subhead reading “This is not about print, this is about a breach of editorial independence.”  The edition had the publication’s general news coverage, but that coverage would not have reached the Indiana student body if the IDS hadn’t taken matters into its own hands. The ad spaces were blacked out and replaced with text showing how much the paper was losing in potential advertising revenue, more evidence that this wasn’t a fiscal decision.  In the face of complete and inexcusable censorship at the hands of their own university, the IDS is showing exactly why journalistic independence is needed in our country. As an independent student media organization, The Daily Nebraskan stands in solidarity with the IDS and with journalists facing censorship nationwide.",2025-10-23T05:00:00Z,2025,10,2025-10,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-chancellor-rodney-bennett-needs-to-face-dei-concerns.html,EDITORIAL: Chancellor Rodney Bennett needs to face DEI concerns,2024-12-06T00:00:00-06:00,The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board,"As the only BIG 10 school without an Office of Diversity and Inclusion, The Daily Nebraskan believes that Chancellor Rodney D. Bennett needs to show up and address DEI concerns for students.  Bennett began his role as chancellor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in July 2023 after previously serving as the president of the University of Southern Mississippi.  Prior to being elected, Bennett openly talked about his plans to face DEI problems at UNL. At a forum on June 6, 2023, he responded to diversity concerns that Executive Associate Athletic Director for Strategic Initiatives, Lawrence Chatters, had about his daughter starting at UNL.  “I will always use the position of chancellor to move the needle forward,” Bennett responded. “As you and others have talked about today, I’ll never sit silent, sit on my hands and not speak up.”  A year after his term started, however, he did just that. After previously acknowledging how much better UNL is “when we have multiple voices around the table,” Bennett decided to shut down ODI on Aug. 20, 2024. This decision also eliminated the position of Vice Chancellor for Diversity and Inclusion.  In a message to students, Bennett said ODI is “no longer right for our institution.”  The message detailed his new decentralized approach that still valued DEI, just in a new way. He emphasized how interactions between people among different backgrounds remain important, yet his following actions told a different story.  While this closure shocked students, Bennett stayed silent. Since the closure, Bennett has sent four messages to students, with only one briefly mentioning these changes.  In this message, Bennett said services are not reduced, but instead dispersed among Vice Chancellors. Bennett assigned larger responsibilities to Vice Chancellors to make up for the closure of ODI.  Bennett gave this small reassurance behind his computer screen, but has yet to address students in person.  The Association of Students for the University of Nebraska and UNL’s NAACP chapter hosted a Q&A session with Bennett for students to get answers to DEI-related questions. However, Bennett himself wasn’t in attendance.  Despite scheduling around Bennett’s events and reaching out on many occasions, Bennett didn’t show up to the town hall. Instead, students took the time to express their frustration about ODI’s closure, while their questions remained unanswered.  Bennett closing ODI and not answering students’ questions face-to-face speaks to where his priorities lie. It’s obvious that there’s a disconnect between Bennett’s words and his actions.  Not attending a Q&A to address student concerns after previously stating how much he cares about diversity on campus is a slap in the face to countless students at UNL. Answering questions from students recently deprived of resources and a sense of community should be the bare minimum from Bennett.  As we enter this next semester, The Daily Nebraskan hopes to see change from Bennett moving forward. Not only acknowledging students’ concerns, but also showing up to planned events would be a great place to start for students to feel like they belong at UNL under Bennett’s leadership.  Students can share their opinions on Bennett’s actions as chancellor by submitting a letter to the editor here.",2024-12-06T06:00:00Z,2024,12,2024-12,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-cutting-student-journalism-cuts-campus-transparency.html,EDITORIAL: Cutting student journalism cuts campus transparency,2025-03-04T00:00:00-06:00,The Daily Nebraskan Editorial Board,"This story was updated at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, March 5, to reflect that a Stanford's Board of Trustees investigation found no evidence to conclude that former Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne personally engaged in research misconduct. Dr. Tessier-Lavigne's resignation letter cited ""the good of the University"" as his reason for stepping down.  The Daily Nebraskan Editorial Board urges universities everywhere to protect student journalism funding and recognize its vital role on campuses.  University administrators and student governments nationwide are slashing funding for college newspapers, threatening both the quality of coverage and survival of these often century-old media outlets. These cuts don’t just hurt student journalists, they also weaken oversight and deprive campus communities of information they deserve.  On Feb. 10, the University of Kansas Student Senate proposed an 80% funding cut for The University Daily Kansan from $3.64 to 75 cents.  ""My whole philosophy for this is if you cut four-fifths of my funding, students are going to get one-fifth of the coverage. It’s that simple,” Courtney Lane, editor-in-chief of The UDK, said.  Recent budget cuts are the latest instance in a long line of attacks against student journalism across the country.  Luckily for The UDK, their Student Senate finance council voted overwhelmingly to reject that bill.  Other newspapers haven’t been as lucky.  The Daily Trojan, a historic student newspaper at the University of Southern California, saw all of its funding cut late last year, eliminating pay for staffers and limiting its print schedule to three days a week.  It was the sole remaining college paper on the West Coast that printed every weekday.  “This decision was made without consulting The Daily Trojan’s student leadership in any capacity. Student Life told us, despite our objections, that their decision was final,” The Daily Trojan Spring 2025 Managing Team said in a letter from the editors.  The Daily Collegian, the 137-year-old newspaper at Penn State University, learned in March 2023 that, starting last August, the paper would lose all funding from PSU’s general fund.  The Collegian’s Board of Directors sent a letter of appeal to Penn State’s President to request holding the newspaper's cut to 15%. They never heard back after an initial acknowledgement that the office received the message.  When PSU initially announced the plan for university-wide budget cuts, it said no unit would receive cuts of more than 4% each year leading up to 2025, according to The Daily Collegian.  Rider University in New Jersey cut funding for its student newspaper, the Rider News, last August, severely limiting its print capabilities.  “It is a shame that our newsstands, where students, faculty and staff alike would normally grab our latest issue, will be empty at times,” Rider News editors said in the article.  Even in Nebraska, student newspapers are taking a hit. The University of Nebraska Omaha cut funding to its newspaper, The Gateway, in April 2023, bringing the senior staff salary budget from $30,000 to $0.  The Gateway was the only organization at UNO that used student fees to pay student salaries.  These aren’t the only cases of student newspaper funding cuts, and they most certainly won’t be the last. As universities across the country continue to struggle with difficult budget decisions, student newspapers are on the chopping block.  Administrators and student governments may view student newspapers as disposable luxuries, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. College media serves as both the training ground for the journalists of tomorrow and the watchdog that holds universities accountable today.  ""Student journalists are the journalists of the future. If we want to continue to hold our government and our society accountable in the coming years, we really need to be investing in the people who are going to be doing that coverage,” Lane said.  Student journalists have long investigated and exposed wrongdoings within their universities. Take, for instance, The Stanford Daily, which investigated claims in 2022 that the university’s president published research papers containing manipulated data. A Stanford Board of Trustees investigation later found evidence of manipulation in certain papers by members of Dr. Tessier-Lavigne's lab, but concluded he did not have knowledge of the misconduct and was in no position to identify it.  Former Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne resigned on Aug. 31, 2023, citing “the good of the University” as his reason for stepping down.  Theo Baker, the head journalist for the investigation, was honored with a George Polk Award for his work.  At the University of Florida, The Independent Florida Alligator conducted an extensive investigation revealing former UF President Ben Sasse’s financial scandal, in which he tripled his office's spending to $17.3 million from the previous president.  It’s not just administration that college newspapers keep an eye on, it’s all programs, even athletics. In July 2023, The Daily Northwestern exposed hazing and sexual assault among the University of Northwestern football team, leading to firing of their head coach.  Without student journalism, these stories would’ve likely gone untold.  When universities cut funding for the voice of the student body, they’re silencing that voice, crippling our ability to hold the people in power in check and ensuring that crucial campus stories go uncovered, with no one to tell the story.  ""We cover the things that no one else will—mold in dorms, student government decisions, university policies that impact students. If we disappear, so does that coverage,” Lane said.  Universities must restore and protect funding for student journalism before they create a generation of campuses where truth is optional.",2025-03-04T06:00:00Z,2025,3,2025-03,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-don-t-let-trump-kill-the-press-act.html,EDITORIAL: Don’t let Trump kill the PRESS Act,2024-12-06T00:00:00-06:00,The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board,"President-elect Donald J. Trump recently pushed for congressional Republicans to block the passage of a federal shield bill intended to protect journalists.  Earlier this year, Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives unanimously passed the Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying, or ‘PRESS’ Act.  This bipartisan measure is designed to limit the government’s ability to compel journalists to reveal their sources and restrict federal law enforcement’s surveillance of the press.  The bill, originally slated for potential passage in the Senate later this month, has now hit a firm roadblock following Trump’s intervention.  On his Truth Social platform, Trump declared, “REPUBLICANS MUST KILL THIS BILL!,"" signaling opposition to the measure, all but ensuring the bill will not pass the Senate floor.  The Daily Nebraskan supports the PRESS Act and condemns the President-elect's attempts to undermine protections for journalists and whistleblowers who work to hold the powerful accountable.  Our publication finds the President-elect’s actions troubling for our staff and the audience we represent. Our student-run newsroom acts independently from the university, allowing our reporters the same press freedoms shared by newspapers across the country.  In the same way that The DN holds UNL’s administration accountable for transgender healthcare without administrative oversight, national publications should retain the same freedom in dealing with the federal government.  A federal shield law for journalists must be passed.  Journalists serve as a watchdog for democracy — uncovering corruption, exposing abuse of power and informing the public. These journalistic pillars depend on the trust that sources and leaks have in their confidentiality with reporters.  Exposing wrongdoings, corruption and abuse of power relies on brave officials and public figures who are willing to bring those issues to light. These sources, with their livelihoods on the line, are hesitant even with shield laws in place.  Federal oversight threatens to create a chilling effect, silencing investigative journalism and eroding public trust. The PRESS Act is not an irrational demand, but rather an extension of the freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  Americans deserve the truth about their elected officials and the government they serve in. Anything less would be unacceptable in our democracy.  For democracy to survive and flourish, the press must remain free to expose the truth, uncover corruption and protect the public interest. The PRESS Act deserves to be passed, and Trump’s efforts to dismantle press protection must not prevail.  There’s no good reason for Trump to oppose the act other than his desire to investigate the press and disregard First Amendment protections.  The President-elect has repeatedly called journalists the “enemy of the people” and a “threat to democracy.” Trump recently vowed to enact vengeance on news outlets that anger him, pledging to toss reporters in jail and hinder major television networks.  In his first term as president, Trump tripled the number of leak investigations, culminating in the seizure of phone records of New York Times reporters in 2017. During the Biden administration, Attorney General Merrick Garland put in place a temporary policy that banned the use of subpoenas, warrants or court orders to seize reporters’ communication records.  Without a federal shield law in place, Trump or another future president’s administration could reverse that regulation.  It speaks volumes that a heavily divided U.S. House unanimously passed the PRESS Act. This clearly shows the heavy support for media independence and journalist confidentiality among all areas of congress, save for the incoming commander-in-chief.  The PRESS Act would protect all journalists, including conservative, independent and liberal media outlets. This is not a partisan issue.  The Daily Nebraskan calls on Congress to pass the PRESS Act and uphold journalistic freedoms among attacks on its very foundation.",2024-12-06T06:00:00Z,2024,12,2024-12,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-how-we-re-fighting-for-covid-transparency-from-the-university.html,Editorial: How we’re fighting for COVID transparency from the university,2020-09-07T14:30:00-05:00,Staff,"On Aug. 27, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln published a COVID-19 dashboard to track positive test results in the campus community. The Daily Nebraskan was glad to see this effort, and we hope it continues to be a valuable resource throughout the semester.  But it’s not enough.  The current situation demands a level of transparency and accountability that, thus far, the university has failed to provide. The effects of this are shown in the questions we receive daily from anxious students through our Curious Cornhuskers initiative.  Students want to know why the university did not publish the case tracker sooner.  Why weren’t students tested for COVID-19 before they moved back into residence halls? What consequences do students in Greek life have for hosting parties?  How many cases is too many, and what point would the university switch to remote learning?  Students want answers — they deserve answers — and The Daily Nebraskan staff is trying its best to provide for them. We created an FAQ page on our website, which we will continually update with answers to your questions and the information you need to know about COVID-19 on campus.  Unfortunately, finding these answers is not always a straightforward process. Few university staff members are able to speak with our reporters, and the administration sometimes doesn’t have an answer at all.  This is a difficult, unprecedented and constantly evolving situation, and we would like to be understanding of that. We know from spending time in our own office that each day presents a new challenge. In the first three weeks of school, 50% of our in-office staff has had to take leave due to symptoms of illness or exposure to someone who tested positive.  As student leaders, we are frustrated with the little guidance the university has provided in dealing with this challenge. Furthermore, we have concerns about how these statistics are echoed in the university community. As journalists, we’d really like to know.  Overall, we’re disappointed with the university’s handling of the return to campus.  We don’t understand why an entire class is not allowed to know that an unnamed peer tested positive. We’re confused by the lack of mask policy enforcement in common spaces and the idea that we are all responsible for reporting those who don’t comply.  We have concerns about the university’s use of “strongly encouraged” when detailing policies on campus. We’re not sure why the Cornhusker Commitment is not mandatory. We don’t think the ratio of 25,000 people to 1 testing site is rational.  The Daily Nebraskan will continue to fight for transparency and answers from the university. In the meantime, you can expect to be hearing from us a lot more — specifically, from our new COVID team.  Under the leadership of former assistant culture editor David Berman and former assistant news editor Zach Wendling, The Daily Nebraskan has dedicated a set staff solely for COVID-19 coverage.  This team will answer all of your COVID-19 questions, whether you submit them through Curious Cornhuskers, DM us on Facebook or go on a Twitter rant that we happen to catch wind of. They will also publish data-driven stories, as well as feature stories about the student perspective of current life on campus.  We want this team to be your go-to source for information, direction and, hopefully, assurance.  So, here’s what we need from you.  If you have a question, submit it at this link. If you have a thought, submit a letter to the editor. To make sure you’re all caught up, subscribe to our newsletter. If you want to join our team, apply here.  We hope to have a successful and healthy semester on campus with you. But even if we have to go back to working from our bedrooms, we will be on your screen, in your pocket and, in spirit, by your side.",2020-09-07T19:30:00Z,2020,9,2020-09,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-maintaining-our-mission-to-tell-the-stories-of-all-unl-students.html,Editorial: Maintaining our mission to tell the stories of all UNL students,2020-04-24T02:00:00-05:00,Karissa Schmidt and Ally Sargus,"The world we live in has changed and continues to change drastically in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most components of our everyday lives have been shifted or put on hold for the time being. For The Daily Nebraskan, this meant a change in plans for our final magazine of the school year. We know that news continues regardless of how you receive it, so we’ve decided to solely publish the stories online instead of printing copies to distribute throughout campus.  Why? The answer is simple: There’s no one here to physically read it, and we want to do our part to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.  Despite the change in format, we want to reassure you that this publication is just as important as any other. Even in this unprecedented time, we will continue to shed light on issues that affect the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and campuses nationwide.  In this edition of The DN, we emphasize the importance of diversity.  Over the last couple of years, diversity has been at the forefront of conversations at UNL. In 2018, a student who was a self-proclaimed white supremacist sparked outrage and fear on campus. The incident caused the university to take action with the ""Hate Will Never Win"" campaign in an effort to restore peace.  This year, students spoke out against the lack of diversity efforts in faculty and student enrollment at UNL. They argued that the few faculty members representing diverse communities makes the transition into college more difficult for students in those communities.  Diversity is crucial to college campuses, and we try to reflect that in our day-to-day news coverage. But we also recognize there are groups on campus who often don’t receive the same level of coverage as others.  We aim to cover several communities, but we understand this collection of stories reflects just a portion of the students on campus.  We highlight individuals on campus who have made an impact on students and colleagues, such as Anna Shavers, the associate dean for diversity and inclusion in the Nebraska College of Law, and Kevin Reese, the OASIS program coordinator.  Through stories about the South of Downtown Art Hub and the band Mental Disturbance, the churches available to students and dining halls with cultural selections, we touch on how students can explore their identities on and off campus.  With Nebraska Athletics as an influential force in Lincoln, we knew it was important to include the stories of athletes in the LGBTQ community and teammates who openly practice their religions.  We even include a timeline of prominent additions to UNL that feature diversity from the university’s creation in 1869 to the present year.  In no way are these stories a complete representation of the diversity on UNL’s campuses, and we encourage students to reach out so that we can continue to diversify our own coverage.  The Daily Nebraskan aims to share the stories of all students on campus and their individual college experiences. Every Husker has their own story that deserves to be told, and it is our mission to tell it.

editorial-pillen-must-apologize-for-his-xenophobic-and-dishonest-ignorance.html,EDITORIAL: Pillen must apologize for his xenophobic and dishonest ignorance,2023-11-03T00:00:00-05:00,The Daily Nebraskan's Editorial Board,"The Daily Nebraskan condemns Gov. Jim Pillen’s recent xenophobic remarks about Yanqi Xu. We urge him to apologize to Xu and recognize how his harmful rhetoric reflects on the potential next generation of Nebraskans.  On Sept. 11, 2023, Pillen responded to a radio host’s question about a report by Yanqi Xu, a 6-year U.S. resident from Guangzhou, China:  “Number one, I didn’t read it and I won’t,” he said. “Number two, all you gotta do is look at the author. Author’s from communist China. What more do you need to know?”  On Oct. 20, Pillen had the opportunity to apologize.  “My comments were my comments,” he said when asked to comment by the Nebraska Examiner.  Pillen is correct: Yanqi Xu did grow up in China. However, his suggestion that her place of birth has anything to do with her reporting is, in our view, disrespectful, repulsive and intolerable. Even if Xu lacked her exceptional pedigree, she and her reporting would still be worth the governor’s respect. In dismissing her as simply “from communist China,” Pillen, knowingly or not, signals to Nebraskans that he will engage with xenophobia when it benefits him.  Emily Taylor, social chair of the Asian Student Union at UNL and whose mother is a Filipina immigrant, told The Daily Nebraskan that the governor’s words make her feel unwelcome.  “When it’s our governor that is saying these things, it really makes me not feel safe, it doesn’t really make me feel supported and it doesn’t make me feel good about the well-being and safety of my family and friends who are also Asian,” Taylor, a senior child, youth and family studies major, said.  “And then I feel like the Nebraska Legislature wonders, well, ‘Why do young people keep leaving Nebraska?’ and, well, it’s because we don’t feel safe and supported,” Taylor continued.  As a successful businessman, Pillen should have responded to the facts of Xu’s article, which reported how high nitrate levels on some of his family’s hog farms could have dangerous downstream effects. Yet, four days after Xu’s story was published, our governor attacked her credibility instead of responding to her reporting.  In doing so, he chose to promote prejudice toward the Chinese — who are already suffering from discrimination, xenophobia and violence stoked by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, according to the Asian American Journalists Association. Pillen should be aware that his purposeful xenophobia fuels further prejudice.  Above all else, Pillen violates a basic human principle: nobody should be judged by where they were born.  The DN rejects Pillen’s divisiveness and his purposeful ignorance. As the sole independent student publication of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, we value integrity, we value diversity and we value honesty.  As an organization of nearly 100 young professionals deciding where to spend the rest of our lives, we rebuke the governor’s words because those words reflect an agenda that alienates us.  The governor’s apology would start to heal the polarization caused by his remarks and underline that xenophobia is unacceptable. The governor’s apology would indicate that he understands that his power to spread hate can also spread community. The governor’s apology would prove that he values integrity, diversity and honesty, too.  The governor must understand that students are listening. Students who agree with these values and that the governor should apologize can write him a letter in support of Xu, or write the DN a letter to the editor.",2023-11-03T05:00:00Z,2023,11,2023-11,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-proposed-cuts-to-unl-exacerbate-brain-drain.html,EDITORIAL: Proposed cuts to UNL exacerbate brain drain,2025-10-01T00:00:00-05:00,The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board,"Brain drain – a topic of discussion spurring up in universities across the country.  This term sits in the minds of those in higher education, defined as an emigration of a state’s most skilled and educated workforce to outside states.  After years of declining and plateauing enrollment numbers, keeping Nebraskan students in the state is becoming increasingly important.  When universities dial back funding and cut programs that house hundreds of eager students who want to stay in the state, they don’t just lose students. They lose the next generation of Nebraskans.  If these cuts go through, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will see over $100 million in budget reductions, cutting down faculty and eliminating programs before our eyes.  With six programs proposed to be cut, this begs the question: Does the federal and state legislatures truly care about halting brain drain?  However, there is no reason to blame NU president Jeffrey Gold or the university as a whole. Gold got the short end of the stick and was expected to repair a university facing state and federal cuts.  Even though the university is trying its best to accommodate programs and strategically make cuts that impact the least amount of students, concerns and anger should be redirected to state and federal legislation that trickled down, affecting students at UNL.  Cuts, such as the Trump administration’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” directly impact the university and its students through research and funding cuts. It must be noted that many of those in charge of these cuts, nationally and state-wide, have been out of college for years, sometimes even decades. Why should those who’ve spent decades outside higher education get to cut programs benefitting hundreds of students at UNL and thousands nationwide?  Although 635 students are enrolled in the programs proposed to be eliminated, the proposed cuts will reduce the state-aided budget by 1% university-wide, saving a total of $4.61 million. Mark Button, interim executive vice chancellor, said that the 1% cut is estimated to save the same amount of money as cutting two mid-sized programs.  This reduction will mean that every college will see the negative impact of budget cuts, even those that do not contain programs on the chopping block.  In addition, the university has budgeted for roughly 38 professors to retire voluntarily, while another 77 will be eliminated, according to Button. 71 of the 77 professors to be let go are tenured or on tenure-track.  By eliminating some of the university’s longest-standing professors, we eliminate some of our greatest resources and strain the remaining faculty by increasing their workload to make up for the losses.  Budget cuts harm not only the university, but Nebraska as a whole. In the face of brain drain, eliminating programs that are the only of their kind in the state and reducing the quality of education that Nebraska’s only public university system provides seems to be a large step in the wrong direction. As the state’s largest employer, the university makes $10 for every $1, clearly showing higher education in the capital city is our state’s money-maker.  If those making budget-related decisions at the federal and state levels are comfortable with offloading budgeting issues to universities, one can’t help but wonder if they really value education.",2025-10-01T05:00:00Z,2025,10,2025-10,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-student-press-freedom-day-importance-of-student-run-newspapers.html,"EDITORIAL: Student Press Freedom Day, importance of student-run newspapers",2022-02-24T00:00:00-06:00,The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board,"The Daily Nebraskan is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s only independent, student-run publication. To us, that’s more than just a description of what we do.  Our editorial choices don’t require approval from a moderator, faculty member or university president. We’re incredibly fortunate to have the freedom that we do, serving as an informed voice of the student body while also bringing light to university issues.  On Student Press Freedom Day, The Daily Nebraskan’s editorial board wants to acknowledge and stand with our fellow student journalists who aren’t as fortunate to have the same level of journalistic freedom. Censorship of the student press, from colleges and universities to high schools, is unacceptable and all student-run publications deserve the same level of editorial freedom that we enjoy.  Even within state borders, that editorial freedom is far from guaranteed.  Although there have been efforts for student press freedom in Nebraska, censorship continues to flourish, especially in Nebraska high schools. Westside High School, who had earned the reputation of producing independent content, began to enforce prior review in 2020 by appointing an administrator to look over every article before it can publish.  On Feb. 12, 2021, Westside High School’s administration censored a student editorial about censorship. Jerred Zegelis, one of the advisors, resigned the same day. After holding the story for a week, the administration approved the editorial to be published, but the students claimed that the damage had already been done.  In January 2021, Sen. Adam Morfield sponsored a bill — LB88 — that would extend free press protections to student journalists and their advisors in public high schools, colleges and universities. Some schools, such as Omaha Public Schools, were not in support of the bill. In March 2021, Nebraska lawmakers advanced the bill but in April 2021, the bill failed to pass after a filibuster.  The Daily Nebraskan is completely independent from the university. We are grateful to receive student fees that we use for facilities, publishing infrastructure and printing. We do not receive any oversight from administration or faculty; all of our daily work is produced by students, for students. Our independent paper, and those like us around the country, is a testament to the power of student press freedom.  Through this freedom, we have been able to use our platform to voice students’ concerns with the university.  When students first returned to campus during the pandemic, we called on the university to be more transparent with COVID-19 protocols. We questioned the lack of safety guidelines for students, the absence of re-entry testing and more. Eventually, the university updated protocols, and our staff continued to investigate the questions students brought to us. One year later, we again pointed out the university’s inability to protect its students after a student was allegedly sexually assaulted. All of which we would not have been able to do if we were working within the constraints of our university system.  While we have been fortunate enough to have press freedom at our publication, other student papers have not. Student Press Freedom Day is Feb. 24, and in recognizing this day we stand with our fellow student journalists to bring awareness to the importance of student press freedom.  Just this past month, The Battalion, which is the student newspaper for Texas A&M University, was told to cease printing with only 24 hours notice. Their university officials have since said the paper can continue printing through the end of the semester after which the paper will go purely digital.  A Student Press Coalition survey from 2018 asked student journalists at Council for Christian Colleges & Universities if they had felt pressure from “university personnel to change, edit or remove an article” after publication. Of the student editors that responded, 76% said yes. Schools should not interfere with journalism. The truth needs to be told, no matter what school officials believe or want to be told.  The theme this year for Student Press Freedom Day is “Unmute Yourself!” The Daily Nebraskan has been unmuted since our founding, but other student journalists still need help to be uncensored. That is why we are using our voice to support the voices of those who can’t write without being censored yet.  Take the time today to find out a little more about your college or high school’s publication. If your state — like Nebraska — doesn’t legally protect student press independence, you can submit a student journalist press freedom restoration act to your legislators. Here is a template for a bill.  We can’t take student journalism for granted, as the situation at Texas A&M shows very clearly. Student newspapers are important staples of their communities that provide a unique opportunity to hold people accountable, and we need to make sure they can keep doing that for years to come.  https://studentpressfreedom.org/",2022-02-24T06:00:00Z,2022,2,2022-02,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL

And as a group of student journalists, we can tell you that doesn’t happen often.  Today, we learned Warren Buffett generously donated $100,000 to The Daily Nebraskan Editorial Support Fund, which helps pay editorial wages.  When we started our #SaveStudentNewsrooms campaign back in April, we set a goal to raise money to continue to train the next generation of professional journalists at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  We're now one step closer to that goal.  We don’t think each donor realizes how much each donation means to the newsroom. Whether it’s $1 or $100,000, each donation is a declaration that the work we do matters.  As any journalist can attest, it hasn’t been the easiest couple of years for the industry. College publications aren’t immune to the struggles that newsrooms across the country have been facing.  Like many newsrooms, we haven’t made a profit in years. Our editors work more than 50 hours a week for less than $3 an hour.  But we love what we do, and we wouldn't trade those hours in for anything.  This donation, and every donation we have received so far, means more than you could possibly know. By donating, you ensure future editors and reporters will have the same opportunities we do.  Your donations have renergized an entire newsroom and rededicated us to our mission as the independent voice of UNL.  From our home in the basement of the Nebraska Union, we thank you.

Not only do reporters and editors graduate, but papers must face declining advertising revenue, the rise of digital media and the constant ebb and flow of the news cycle.  The Daily Nebraskan is no different. Like most news outlets, we’ve witnessed our revenue decline sharply and consistently in recent years. In 2017, we made the substantial leap from publishing a newspaper to a monthly magazine, The DN. We’ve also explored reaching our readers through our new culture, news and sports podcasts.  In spite of these changes, The Daily Nebraskan has stood firm in our independence from UNL’s direction, our pursuit of truth and our commitment to bringing the day’s news to the student body.  Even while working long hours and for less than minimum wage, we as editors refuse to budge on our core values. We’ve held these principles for over a century and have no intention of ever deviating from them.  Unfortunately for many college campuses across the United States, this journalistic integrity has come under threat. Papers directly affiliated with their universities have faced pressure to avoid reporting on sensitive stories, and at times have suffered stiff consequences for pursuing the truth. Just last year, two editors of Liberty University’s The Champion were fired for allegedly not presenting a positive enough image of the college. The University of North Alabama’s The Flor-Ala’s adviser was removed by the university in a move that was condemned as “retaliation for Constitutionally protected student speech” by the College Media Association.  Although we oftentimes take our journalistic liberty for granted at UNL, we’ve nonetheless remained vigilant over the years to maintain our independence.  In light of this, The Daily Nebraskan joins with other student newspapers across the country today in support of the Student Press Law Center’s Student Press Freedom Day.  We hope you join us in the effort to protect the student press in all its forms.  This year, The Daily Nebraskan has reported on the lasting legacy of Cornhusker Marching Band member Tyler Butterfield, the bond between a Husker football player and his fiancee, UNL’s transition to a new student advocate for sexual assault survivors and changes at the University Health Center. As always, we’ve kept ASUN accountable to you through our coverage of their weekly meetings.  Although we strive every day to bring you the highest-quality news possible, our efforts are for naught without you, the reader.  In this era of change, we humbly ask for your continued support.

editorial-the-daily-nebraskan-is-not-diverse-here-s-how-we-re-fixing-it.html,Editorial: The Daily Nebraskan is not diverse; here’s how we’re fixing it,2020-10-05T02:00:00-05:00,Drake Keeler,"Media organizations across the country had a reckoning on race this summer.  Following the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and many others, the summer of 2020 was filled with protests. Americans were forced to examine the prevalence of racism in our everyday lives. For newsrooms, this meant re-examining how we cover Black communities, along with other underrepresented groups.  The Daily Nebraskan is no exception to newsrooms that need to take this necessary step. In April, before racial injustice was at the forefront of national news, we published an online magazine covering diversity on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s campus.  While it was a step in the right direction, there’s still more work to do. In June, we published an editorial communicating our support of the Black community and responding to criticism of our protest coverage.  Now, we’re taking another step. Once again, we won’t be putting out a physical magazine. Instead, we’ll publish an online project focused on Black Lives Matter and Black stories on campus, both now and historically. I, Drake Keeler, will be leading this project, which will feature multiple sections.  The first part of the project is this one right here, talking about our own newsroom diversity. The second will focus on the evolution of the Black Lives Matter movement, history of anti-Black racism at UNL and stories of Black trailblazers. Lastly, we will look at the current movements happening on campus and aim to capture what the Black experience is like for UNL students now.  But diversity and racism aren’t things to only cover in a special magazine or project. We should constantly be covering and addressing these things in our newsroom.  The reason we’re doing this now is not because it’s a hot topic that would attract readers. The point of this project is to put a spotlight on Black stories that haven’t been told enough or at all. This is meant to set in place a precedent to tell the stories of all people for years to come.  Before we do that, however, we must look at our own failures. As you look at the first edition of our annual newsroom diversity report, you’ll see that I’m the only Black person on The Daily Nebraskan’s staff. Yes, this means that almost none of the contributors to this project will be Black. While I made the choice to lead this project, and it was never something forced on me, it’s also clear that there weren’t a whole lot of diverse options.  I joined The Daily Nebraskan my freshman year in October of 2018. In the two years since, the lack of diversity — racial and otherwise — has been glaring. Reporting our diversity statistics annually will help us and the UNL community hold The Daily Nebraskan accountable.  Journalism as an industry has a diversity problem, and Nebraska is included in this. As Nebraska media outlets, we can send feel-good messages about how we support diversity, or we can put the work in to make structural change.  Along with telling the stories of all students on campus, The Daily Nebraskan has a responsibility to prepare young journalists for their future careers. We aren’t meeting this standard to the fullest if we aren’t creating an environment where all aspiring journalists and writers can come in and feel accepted for years to come.  That’s why, as part of this project, we will be launching The Daily Nebraskan Diversity and Inclusion Board. This board will include voices from both inside and outside The Daily Nebraskan, and it will have the purpose of fostering more inclusive coverage and a more diverse newsroom.  Making concerted efforts to be inclusive will create a larger pool of qualified, diverse journalists that can help make the Nebraska media market better. Of course, other publications across the state also need to do their part to make that work.  As the founder of the board, I will take on the privilege of becoming its first internal chair. On Wednesday, Oct. 7, applications will open to fill the board with an external chair and other members.  Having an external chair and board members from outside of The Daily Nebraskan will be crucial to the success of the board. While internal members will not be afraid to give criticism, we can’t always analyze our own work as objectively as those outside of our organization. I’m looking forward to building this team and working to make change with Nebraska students who are just as passionate about diversity and inclusion.  When complete, this board will focus on improving The Daily Nebraskan’s recruitment practices, making sure its coverage is inclusive and hearing from community voices.  Expanding on that last point, we’re looking to get UNL’s underrepresented communities involved in the creation of this project, even if you aren’t a part of The Daily Nebraskan. If you have any story ideas, questions, comments or concerns, you can make a submission to our Curious Cornhuskers initiative or email me at drakekeeler@dailynebraskan.com. In the near future, we’ll be creating even more opportunities for community feedback.  I’d like to reiterate that this is not just a semester project by a student newspaper. This is the start of a structural effort to make long-term change for the better in the media landscape.  Here’s to a more inclusive future,  Drake Keeler  drakekeeler@dailynebraskan.com",2020-10-05T07:00:00Z,2020,10,2020-10,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL

These protests follow the May 25 death of George Floyd — a Minneapolis man who died after ex-officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.  Also in the last week, The Daily Nebraskan has sent editors, reporters and photographers to protests in Lincoln and Omaha. We’ve observed the scene, collected quotes and taken photographs in hopes of telling a fair and complete account of these events.  In this time, we’ve received concerns from our readers about the language in some of our headlines and captions. Specifically, concerns about us downplaying the severity of the situation or that our writing implied a bias toward a specific side.  As a news organization, The Daily Nebraskan cannot take sides. We must remain neutral, even in the most divisive of times. Taking a stance would jeopardize our ability to provide our readers with the full picture.  Our job is to report facts and observations. We can only hope to accurately inform our readers; what our readers choose to do with or think of that information is not up to us.  In reporting these facts, we must be clear and literal, and we are very careful about the language we choose.  For example, we cannot refer to the deaths of Floyd or James Scurlock as murders because the law has not decided Chauvin or Jake Gardner are murderers. If the defendant has not been prosecuted, the law says the defendant is innocent.  So, we too have to say the defendant is innocent. We cannot call the individual a murderer, nor can we call the individual’s act a murder.  What we can say is that we stand with the Black community — our readers, our peers, our educators and our staffers — in the fight against systemic racism.  This April, The Daily Nebraskan published a series of articles about diversity with one goal: Tell the stories of all University of Nebraska-Lincoln students.  We recognize that, while the university has taken steps in increasing diversity and inclusion on campus, there is considerate work to be done. We also recognize that we have a responsibility to use our platform to give a voice to those who are most often overlooked.  So, this project was just the beginning. We want to continue to educate our readers and ourselves by sharing the stories of Black and other minority communities.  But reporting outward isn’t enough. To stop systemic racism, we must look inward. We acknowledge that we have work to do in the diversity of both our coverage and our newsroom. We are actively working to expand the reach of our coverage to include all identities on campus and recruit a more diverse staff for our publication.  Going forward, we want to be known as both an ally and as an ethical source. Our job is twofold: report fairly and provide a voice for our community. We encourage students to take part in that coverage by joining our staff, submitting questions or writing letters to the editor.  The Daily Nebraskan wants to hold both ourselves and our leaders accountable, and we invite you to help us do that.",2020-06-07T02:28:00Z,2020,6,2020-06,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-unl-must-take-swift-definitive-action-to-prevent-more-sexual-violence.html,"EDITORIAL: UNL must take swift, definitive action to prevent more sexual violence",2021-08-31T09:30:00-05:00,The Daily Nebraskan Editorial Board,"Dear readers,  In light of the alleged sexual assault at Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board started crafting an editorial in response. Before we could publish it, another fraternity faced sexual assault allegations.  That leads us to ask — how many more sexual assaults need to occur before the university takes action?  By now, most everyone thinks they know the story. Reports of an alleged sexual assault at FIJI surfaced on Tuesday, Aug. 24, and by that night the fraternity was subject to campus-wide protests. Those protests continued for four consecutive days, and organizers plan to continue protesting until the university takes decisive action.  Here’s the problem. UNL’s track record of managing sexual assault on campus makes it impossible to believe that decisive action will take place. There’s more of a possibility the situation will be mismanaged, swept under the rug and repeated.  That cannot happen again.  To university administrators, we have a simple message: You have consistently failed at keeping your students safe. You have failed the community.  The events of last week are the latest in a long, long list of colossal administrative failures at combating sexual violence on campus.  In the past, the closest the university got to a sexual misconduct training — besides the one implemented in the spring — was in fall 2015 when students were strongly recommended to complete an online course. Less than 40% of students completed the training.  Between 1988 and 2001, there were speakers, conferences, a candlelit vigil and one other unrequired training put on by university groups at the time, according to Daily Nebraskan archives. There was no mention of required training for students on sexual misconduct before 2015.  Several alumni and past students — ranging from the past decade to the 1980s — have told The Daily Nebraskan they were never required to take sexual misconduct training.  While there is a fraternity-specific sexual assault prevention program called Husker Man, that program is run entirely through the Interfraternity Council and is not affiliated with the university.  The most recent training implemented in the spring was asynchronous, hidden behind a screen and filled with jokes that were insensitive to survivors of sexual assault or harrassment.  It supposedly had consequences for students who did not take it, but a university official in the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance confirmed these are “currently being developed” and the community will be “notified” once those have been completed.  Beyond reminder emails telling students they have not completed training, there are no consequences. There is no published record of how many students have completed the training. The university wasn’t able to provide concrete data on how many students took the training.  Several students have said they did not take the training; some didn’t even know about it. Those who did take it found issues with the training. Hey university, you think “U Got This?” U didn’t.  If the university took the time to both listen to students and look into best practices for sexual assault prevention training, it would be able to see a few common themes in what a better sexual assault prevention training would consist of. Beyond the extremely comprehensive and in-depth report that the Chancellor’s Collaborative created, there are a number of national guidelines and recommendation reports, including these reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the North Carolina Commission Against Domestic Violence.  If the university wants to make substantial changes to the rape culture on campus, they need to take these reports and students’ concerns into account.  While online training may be easier to facilitate, it is not the answer to preventing sexual assault on campus. Furthermore, the guidelines from these organizations echo what meta-analyses have concluded: these programs are most effective when they are in person, targeted towards the specific needs of the audience and run by properly trained staff.  The “U Got This!” training doesn’t address any of these issues. In fact, one of the biggest problems we noted with the training is that it was too broad and overly generic. Sexual assault prevention training works best when it is split into separate sections — ideally, split between men, women and LGBTQA+ individuals, with separate trainings specifically tailored to each group.  If a training is presented to a general audience, it runs the risk of either being insensitive to women’s specific needs and concerns when it comes to sexual assault or sending the men in the group the message that sexual assault is something that’s common and acceptable while trying to address women’s issues and validate the traumatic experiences that 13% of all college women go through.  The university announced and later formed a Campuswide Collaborative on Sexual Misconduct focused on reforms in late 2019. Faculty, staff and many students culminated this almost yearlong work into a report published online on Oct. 5, 2020, with 22 specific recommendations.  The report, labeled as “a roadmap for creating and maintaining a caring campus community,” includes recommendations for a Chancellor’s Commission on Sexual Misconduct — currently in the process of selecting members — and annual training for incoming faculty, staff and students. The collaborative also recommended a campus-wide sexual misconduct needs assessment and biennial climate survey.  While the university has adopted and promoted an affirmative consent policy and trained all employees involved in the Title IX process in trauma-informed care, there is still a long way to go. Some relatively simple recommendations are to include a statement on sexual misconduct in course syllabi, require trauma-informed training on sexual misconduct for key campus offices, programs and organizations and develop a clear description of avenues for reporting, investigating, hearing and appealing cases of sexual misconduct, all of which have yet to be implemented.  Last week, the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska held a town hall style meeting with Chancellor Ronnie Green and around 70 student leaders from recognized student organizations and Greek life. What did students get out of that meeting? An email with a video of Green telling boys that rape isn’t cool. Even with protests and that message, there was still an alleged sexual assault that night at Sigma Chi.  Simply put, the university’s efforts are not enough.  We’re glad ASUN and other student leaders got the chance to speak with Green, but nothing from that meeting has been made public. No change has occurred. What forum is being offered to sexual assault survivors? Whose voices deserve to be elevated?  With this in mind, here are some actions the university can take today to start holding itself accountable for the safety of this campus.  First, they can immediately publish how many students have completed the “mandated” training. Students need to know just how many of their peers have completed a training that, while as incomplete and flawed as we’ve described, is still one of the only educational resources put in place to prevent sexual violence.  Second, students need a voice. As demonstrated by the weeklong protests on campus — which university officials have yet to attend despite nightly calls for their support — students are fed up with the inaction and lack of help. Hundreds of students spent their first week of classes marching through the streets of campus and downtown, pleading with the university for safety, and the university’s leaders haven’t even shown up to listen.  Third, actually use student input to swiftly and effectively create stronger measures to end on-campus culture of sexual violence and rape. Replace the current training to better align with the goals of the Chancellor’s Collaborative and show greater respect and sensitivity to survivors of sexual violence. The university needs to hold mandatory, in-person sexual assault prevention training. They need to look people in the eye when they tell them not to sexually assault someone.  No more sweeping it under the rug and making empty promises.  In a similar vein to Chancellor Green’s comments last week: If you’re an administrator who somehow thinks this is enough — think again. It is unacceptable.",2021-08-31T14:30:00Z,2021,8,2021-08,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL

Creating it was strange, too.  But we want you to know we did everything in our power to make sure we could. Here, we're giving you an online option, too.  Since the middle of March, The Daily Nebraskan has been running an entirely virtual operation in an attempt to stay connected with our readers.  We don’t usually publish regularly in the summer, but we broke tradition this year to provide you with the information needed to navigate these unprecedented times. Additionally, our staff explored digital platforms besides our website, making use of Instagram, Zoom and Twitch in an attempt to break our own norms and cover important topics in engaging ways.  Along with revamping our publication style, our staff members spent their summer gathering information on how this week’s return to campus is possible. Though everything is up in the air, we worked to make our stories as relevant as possible by the time you read this. For example, we’re unsure if fall sports will happen, but wanted to give you a look into how things might go down.  The uncertainty of this semester can be unnerving. The University of Nebraska was quick to push for in-person classes, as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. In this magazine, however, you’ll learn how hard the UNL community — your community — has been working to ensure the safety of students and staff this fall.  We’ve been working hard, too. Each year, we run a back to school issue of The DN magazine to help freshmen get a feel for campus and show students what they can look forward to. This year looks a little different. We call it “back to school... in a pandemic.”  Instead of highlighting students and events, we turned our attention to the faculty, staff and student leaders that made our return to campus possible. In these 36 pages, you’ll learn what you can expect from on-campus living and dining, classroom settings and extracurriculars, among many other things.  Why? To show that we are here for you. We are students too; we know the anxieties you’re facing first hand. We are right there alongside you, hesitant to touch every surface and frightened by every cough.  But we believe in the value of in-person education, as well as face-to-face interaction. Additionally, our reporting for these stories has shown how well-thought-out this return to campus is. We know the behind the scenes of the planning, and we think it is important for you to know, too.  While there are worries about coming back, we’re glad to be back with you. Even more so, we’re glad you trusted us enough to pick up this magazine, no matter how scary it may have seemed.  Safe wishes,  The DN staff",2020-08-18T05:00:00Z,2020,8,2020-08,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-why-ronnie-greens-criticisms-of-the-title-ix-article-are-unfounded.html,Editorial: Why Ronnie Green's criticisms of the Title IX article are unfounded,2019-04-24T03:00:00-05:00,Editorial Board,"The Daily Nebraskan received a letter from University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Ronnie Green on Tuesday, April 23, addressing the Title IX article that was published earlier this month.  Although we value substantive critiques as a means of improving our reporting, we felt the letter’s criticism of our Title IX investigation was unfounded.  Green’s letter addressed several issues he saw with the article. His first grievance was that the article didn’t explain that UNL has a new victim advocate on campus, which replaced Voices of Hope as the official victim advocate for the university. The article clearly explains that UNL now has its own victim advocate.  Later in the article, there is a more in-depth explanation as to what the victim advocate does, addressing all of the concerns Green said were omitted from the article:  “UNL’s victim advocates, which work out of the University Health Center, are employees who connect students with campus and community resources, explain the Title IX process and inform survivors of options like academic modifications, housing changes, and ‘no-contact’ orders, according to Leslie Reed, UNL’s public affairs director.  The two in-house victim advocates provide a combined 80 hours each week of victim advocacy to the university. Reed said this constitutes a significant increase compared to the part-time support of 10 hours per week provided previously through Voices of Hope.  While the advocates have a cooperative relationship with the Title IX office, Reed said they are independent from the office and are not accountable to it.  ‘Our advocates’ first job is to listen to victims and to provide them a safe and confidential place to find the emotional, psychological and legal resources they need,’ she said in an email.  Reed said UNL followed in the footsteps of other Big Ten universities by hiring a full-time victim advocate in the summer of 2018. She said Melissa Wilkerson, the university’s lead victim advocate, worked as a victim advocate from 2000 to 2014 in a Colorado District Attorney’s office and also has provided advocacy service to women’s shelters in Kansas and Colorado.  ‘The university regretfully ended its contractual relationship with Voices of Hope in 2018 as part of its decision to internalize and expand advocacy services on campus,’ she said in an email. ‘This new approach brings us into line with the best practices of other universities across the country.’”  The Daily Nebraskan reached out to the UNL Victim Advocate’s office for an interview, but the office redirected us to Reed. The article still provided a clear definition of campus resources and why the decision was made to end the contractual relationship between the university and Voices of Hope.  Green also said he was concerned the article did not clearly differentiate the role of the Title IX office from that of the victim advocate, and by doing so could “result in many other students choosing to not to come forward and get the support they need.”  Again, the article clearly explains what the role of the Title IX office is and why people who come into the office believing it will be like a victim advocate service are often confused and disappointed. Tami Strickman, UNL’s Title IX coordinator, offered an explanation of what the office is herself in the article:  “Strickman said she understands how students who go in believing Title IX is a victim advocate organization can experience it as a cold, unfeeling office.  ‘One of the statements that we hear, not only in this office, but across the nation … is we’re often referred to the non-emotional people on campus,’ she said. ‘And we certainly don’t want to be perceived that way, per say, but at the same time, we have a very difficult job to do, where we have to assess information as it’s been presented to us and draw conclusions and analyses based on that information.’  UNL’s Title IX office conducts neutral investigations and is vested with less power than it’s assumed to have, according to Strickman. She said the office doesn’t make unilateral decisions, so they work with other university offices to help accommodate survivors.  Strickman said the office can work with professors and teaching assistants if a survivor’s trauma causes them to need an extension on a project, but it can’t make academic decisions directly. The office can also work with residence directors and assistants to accommodate those in uncomfortable living situations after an incident.”  The Daily Nebraskan brought these survivor stories to light to show how survivors are being treated during the Title IX process. Survivors told stories of how the Title IX process was confusing, mentally and emotionally exhausting and above all, traumatizing.  Phoebe, a survivor for whom we used a pseudonym in the article, said she wasn’t angry at UNL for how Title IX treated her, but rather was disappointed because she felt the university excels in so many other areas, but fails to protect survivors.  These survivors are students who trusted the university to treat them with dignity and respect when they came forward with sexual misconduct claims. Instead, they said they were met with an apathetic office that some said only traumatized them more:  “Sheridan Thomas was raped as a 17-year-old freshman in August 2015. She said her experience dealing with the Title IX office at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln was worse than any trauma she experienced at the hands of her rapist.  ‘My experience with them was awful,’ she said. ‘It was … way worse than the trauma that I had already gone through, so it’s just like extra trauma I didn’t need. And if I would have known that, I wouldn’t have gone to them.’”  The Daily Nebraskan appreciates Green’s concern for survivor stories, and we value any reader feedback, but we found Green’s criticisms to be without warrant.  If you or someone you know has had an experience with the Title IX office you’d like to share with The Daily Nebraskan, please email investigations@dailynebraskan.com.",2019-04-24T08:00:00Z,2019,4,2019-04,EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
editorial-winner-take-all-is-not-the-change-nebraska-needs.html,EDITORIAL: Winner-take-all is not the change Nebraska needs,2024-10-10T22:47:00-05:00,The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board,"The Daily Nebraskan opposes lawmakers’ push for a winner-take-all system for Nebraska’s electoral votes, and applauds State Sen. Mike McDonnell’s decision against supporting the change.  In 1992, Nebraska adopted the congressional district method, allocating three of the state’s five electoral votes to the popular vote winner in each district. The state’s current system of splitting electoral votes is distinct — joined only by Maine — and it reflects the diverse urban and rural populations in Nebraska.  Winner-take-all would erase that balance, diminishing the voices of those in such districts that might vote differently from the statewide majority.  While Nebraska's first and third districts have consistently followed the state majority, Nebraska’s second congressional district, including Omaha, has gone for Democratic candidates in two recent presidential elections, including for President Joe Biden in 2020.  This “blue dot” could be the deciding factor in who wins this year's presidential election, depending on how voting in pivotal swing states goes. Vice President Kamala Harris currently holds a lead over former President Donald Trump in the state’s second congressional district.  It’s clear why Republicans are pushing to change Nebraska’s electoral system.  Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said earlier this month that he would call a special legislative session to vote on becoming a winner-take-all state if there was enough senator support.  On Sept. 23, Pillen discovered he did not have the support he needed from key Sen. Mike McDonnell, meaning Republicans did not have the 33 votes needed to overcome a filibuster to change to winner-take-all.  “Elections should be an opportunity for all voters to be heard, no matter who they are, where they live or what party they support,” McDonnell said in a statement. “After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from election day, is not the moment to make this change.”  That change cannot be made, at least not in this way.  In a response to McDonnell’s stance against winner-take-all, Pillen found the decision disappointing to himself and others who worked to ensure all Nebraskans’ votes are sought after equally.  It’s a bold statement from someone who’s trying to suppress Omaha’s voice in the democratic process. That's 133,563 registered Democrats, according to a Nebraska Secretary of State voter registration statistic, whose voices would not be heard.  In the tight presidential race our nation finds itself in, every vote counts. By switching the way Nebraska counts its electoral votes, at this time, the state risks becoming a tool for short-term political gain, rather than continuing to serve in the best interests of Nebraskans.  Nebraska’s district-based system forces candidates to campaign in competitive districts, whereas the winner-take-all system leads to an intense focus only on battleground states.  “For Omaha, the city I love and have called home for 58 years, it brings tremendous national attention, is impactful on our local economy and forces presidential candidates to make their case to all Nebraskans, instead of just flying over and disregarding us,” McDonnell said in a statement.  If implemented, this dramatic switch in the state’s electoral system has the potential for long-term harm and an increase in voter distrust in Nebraska. This decision would likely be perceived as changing the political rules of our state to benefit one party or candidate, reducing confidence in a fair and democratic election.  If such a decision is to ever be made, it should be up to Nebraska voters, not politicians looking for an advantage.  Maintaining Nebraska’s current electoral system isn’t about preserving Omaha’s “blue dot” or making sure Republicans don’t get total control over the state. It’s about sending a message that changing the electoral process of a state this close to the presidential election for the purpose of a political short-term gain is unjust to the people of Nebraska, voters across the country and the foundations upon which our nation was built.

election-donald-trump-project-2025-democrats.html,OPINION: We are not doomed,2024-11-14T00:00:00-06:00,Dawson Iasillo,"The aftermath of the election left Democrats across the country feeling hopeless. Many fear for the end of democracy and what may happen to the state of America in another Donald Trump presidency.  People across the country have tons of concerns about Trump being elected once again. His manic behaviors, age and extremist views are just a few to mention.  One of the biggest concerns amongst Americans is the idea of Project 2025, an extreme right-wing set of ideologies that would set America back decades. While Trump claimed that he is not associated with Project 25, tons of his colleagues and people on his team helped write it and confirmed that Trump endorses it.  America is a resilient country and has gone through much worse than the wrath of Trump. While there should be some fear and skepticism, a complete feeling of hopelessness and doom should not be the feeling right now.  We have survived a Trump administration once before. Trump had tons of promises that he failed to keep and only accomplished about three policies that he proposed. His outlandish claim that he would “build a wall and make Mexico pay” simply never went through. There were already 452 miles of wall built prior to the Trump administration and his administration only successfully added 80 more miles.  As scary as it may seem, primary elections will be held in two years. This means people can vote on who sits on the House of Representatives and the Senate to veto or approve Trump’s bills.  In two years, it will be hard to gain enough traction for a plan as eccentric as Project 25. America can count on tons of people opposing this, including Trump voters from this election. When people start to realize the far-right rhetoric, it’s likely that many will vote blue in the next primary election.  While Trump is a scarily unpredictable man, one thing about him is predictable: his art of driving people away. After his first four years in office, only half of his cabinet continues to support and endorse him. It also speaks volumes when his own vice president, Mike Pence, said he could not endorse him out of “good conscience”.  With his agenda being even more conservative and controversial for this upcoming term, we can likely expect a decline in his supporters from the inside and perhaps a crumble of his cabinet as a whole.  Democrats feel like DoomsDay is underway, but this is only wasting time for the action that could be taken prior to Trump’s inauguration. It is completely valid to have feelings of hopelessness and disappointment with the state of America. However, sitting back and watching it all happen will only further dig our own grave. There are tons of opportunities that could change the trajectory of what is to come and plenty of volunteer positions up for grabs.  Democrats need to start preparing for what may or may not be coming. It is not the time to sit back and wallow in sadness. This country thrives from different perspectives and with the House of Representatives, Senate and Presidential seats being in control by Republicans, Democrats need to step up and find a way to continue to influence the American government.

fight-against-alzheimers.html,Fight Against Alzheimer's,2025-03-11T00:00:00-05:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"When I was a freshman in high school my grandmother moved in with us because she was no longer safe on her own. My mother explained that she had Alzheimer’s and dementia, but as a kid, I didn’t understand what this really meant.  I had only been exposed to it in Grey’s Anatomy because Meredith’s mother developed Alzheimer’s. This wasn’t the best representation of the disease. Her mother would forget who she was and have angry outbursts, but then she would have episodes where she remembered Meredith. The disease is much more than memory loss, and I couldn’t understand Alzheimer’s until my grandma was diagnosed.  Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia, which is a general term for loss of memory. It affects memory, thinking and behavior. Over time, symptoms grow severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.  Alzheimer’s accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases, making it the most common cause of dementia. The disease is progressive, so it worsens over time. While it starts as a fuzzy memory, it can turn into the inability to carry a conversation and respond to the environment. There is no cure for the disease. Typically, people live four to eight years after the diagnosis, but can live as long as 20 depending on certain factors.  Alzheimer’s may not be curable, but it is important to be aware of the diagnosis and understand ways to delay the disease physically and mentally.  Even when my grandmother was first diagnosed, I never researched the disease. It is important to understand what Alzheimer’s really means and how the disease works. While the cause is still unknown, it can be due to age-related changes in the brain such as shrinking and inflammation.  Genes can also affect the onset of the disease as well as health, lifestyle and environmental factors. Memory loss is often the first sign, but other symptoms include word-finding, vision and spatial issues, impaired reason and judgement, struggle with daily tasks, wandering and behavioral changes.  It is important to make sure that those diagnosed are getting regular medical care. There are lots of support systems and services that will help patients and caretakers deal with this diagnosis. It is a good idea for someone with Alzheimer’s to move in with a loved one or into a home where they can be monitored.  Like most diseases, Alzheimer’s can be delayed with a healthy lifestyle that includes staying physically active. Staying active can help reduce falls, maintain mobility and promote heart health. Physical activity is important because it reduces the risk of depression, diabetes, high blood pressure and strokes. These health conditions can contribute to age-related cognitive decline along with dementia.  It is smart to stop smoking and keep alcohol to a minimum when delaying Alzheimer’s. Eating a healthy and balanced diet while remembering to exercise is a good way to stay in good shape to fight off the disease.  Mental health is another important aspect of delaying Alzheimer’s. There is some evidence that suggests rates of dementia are lower in people who remain mentally and socially active throughout their lives. Reading, learning new languages, playing musical instruments and maintaining a social life are all good ways to keep the mind active. This will help delay the disease.  There are plenty of clinical trials that also allow elderly patients to try cognitive training. These trials have shown that specific cognitive training can improve cognitive performance, but since it is early development, we can’t tell how great the effect is long-term.  It can be hard to stay positive considering there is still no cure for Alzheimer’s. There may not be a proven way to prevent Alzheimer’s, but researchers are working everyday to figure out more about this disease. There are constant advancements and treatments that help us learn more. We can still fight.  An Alzheimer’s diagnosis is difficult to comprehend, especially when it starts affecting the people around us. It is important to understand the disease and start delaying the symptoms early. Importantly, don’t lose hope. Alzheimer’s is at the forefront of biomedical research, and researchers are constantly working to uncover aspects of the disease.

The Daily Nebraskan regrets to report that this week, we discovered one of our reporters had failed in that pursuit.  On Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2016, it came to our attention a reporter fabricated quotes in a recently published article under the headline “UNL’s Johnny Carson School performs comedy ‘Fuddy Meers.’”  The Daily Nebraskan has since retracted the inaccurate information included in the article in question, written by Mary Hope Mulcahy. We have also removed the reporter from The Daily Nebraskan staff.  Mulcahy cited two sources: Emily Callahan and Adam Turner, both University of Nebraska-Lincoln students who were indicated in the story to have been involved in the production of “Fuddy Meers.” We have spoken to Callahan and Turner, both of whom have denied participating in an interview with a Daily Nebraskan reporter in reference to this story.  The information attributed to these sources has proven to be false, and Mulcahy has admitted to fabricating quotes attributed to the two students.  While Mulcahy has expressed regret for her actions, it has become clear that this is not the only article in which she included fabricated quotes. The Daily Nebraskan is working to verify the authenticity of the facts and sources included in the remainder of this reporter’s stories and will correct each of these stories as we are able.  We were disappointed to find the reporter included false information in her work, but we also regret our own failure to recognize these errors in the editing process. We have reviewed our fact-checking processes and will continue to discuss how we can ensure errors of this nature are avoided in the future.  We sincerely apologize to those affected by the errors -- namely those who have been misrepresented as a result of Mulcahy’s fictitious reporting -- but we also apologize to our readers, with whose trust we understand has been compromised.  We are taking steps to rebuild this trust: Starting immediately, we are requiring reporters of all experience levels to submit source verification forms for each story, listing the name, title and contact information of each source cited.  Regardless of our status as a student newspaper, we strive for professionalism in all of our endeavors. Readers, rest assured we will continue to work diligently to serve the University of Nebraska-Lincoln community in seeking and reporting what you deserve: the truth.

how-my-space-has-affected-me.html,FARRELL: How my space has affected me,2024-12-05T00:00:00-06:00,Sophie Farrell,"Growing up, I've always been able to function in a chaotic environment. All of my life I considered myself to be as type B as humanly possible. My room always reflected that as well. I wasn't concerned with my space being perfectly clean and would find every excuse on why I didn't have time to clean it.  I'm aware that this is a terrible and very immature way of thinking, but I really didn't mind. It wasn't because I was purely lazy. I did well in school, I was constantly doing some type of extra curricular activity, and I started working consistently at age 14. I think the reason why I was okay with my space being chaotic is because the world around me wasn't. I had a good group of friends, great family and I was situated in my hometown in Minnesota.  I decided to come to Lincoln, Nebraska for college with this same headspace. I thought that I would quickly figure things out and create a life that gave me the same kind of stability as my life in Minnesota did. I had the freedom to create an entirely new world for myself.  I lived in a suite-style dorm my freshman year and made some of the best memories of my life. I had an amazing roommate and suitemates who became my best friends. I had an entirely new space that felt like my own.  However, I quickly realized that I wasn't as secure in my world in Nebraska as I was in Minnesota. I had no parents to tell me when it was time to clean up my room or teachers to make sure I kept my grades up. Suddenly I was all on my own, and I felt like I had lost a sense of control.  My grades were rapidly dropping, and my room was cleaned less and less to the point where I realized that I needed to shift my mindset on college and freedom. I couldn't physically allow myself to live in the chaos I put myself in anymore.  My sophomore year I moved into my sorority house. It was a new space, a restart. I had about 1/10 of the space I had in my suite, so It was much easier to control how clean I was. I wasn't perfectly clean, but If I wanted any space to live in, I had to make sure I had things put away.  Living in a sorority house came with a whole other set of challenges, though. All of a sudden I was sharing a space with 65 other girls who were living very different lives than me, girls who would study more than me, go to the gym more than me and be more social than me, too. It seemed like the girls in my sorority had college figured out while I was still struggling to recover from the bad habits that I had set for myself freshman year.  I felt a sense of motivation to model after the girls I saw around me. I got to build friendships while going about my daily life and made some of the best friends ever. However, it got hard constantly comparing myself to the girls around me. I felt a pull to be a million different versions of myself just so I could convince myself that I also had college figured out. In the process, I put so much stress on myself.  Now, I am living in an apartment with my three best friends that I made in Lincoln. I have gained a new appreciation for the time that I get to spend alone and made sure that my room was a place where I could relax. We also collaborated on our shared space so that it was an inviting place where we could all be together. We switched out the stiff couch that came with our room for a nice, big comfy one. Our living room would be the comfiest place in our apartment.  Now that I have lived in three vastly different places in some of the most transformative years of my life, I have learned some very valuable lessons about how my space affects me. First, I am no longer going to allow my space to get out of control because that soon contributes to the lack of control I feel in my life. Second, although it was fun for a year, there is a reason why we don't see big houses with 70 people living in them more often. The last and most important thing I learned is that with the right people and the right space, life feels just that much easier.  Sophie Farrell is a Junior Broadcasting and Journalism double major.

husker-fans-are-a-problem.html,OPINION: Husker fans are still the problem a year later,2024-12-03T00:00:00-06:00,Jalen-Thomas Kroger,"Last September, I wrote an article on how I felt about the current Husker fan base, titled “Husker fans are the problem.” This article was written in not only my first year at Nebraska, but also Matt Rhule’s first year.  When I wrote that article I wanted to chronicle what the state of Nebraska fans was like at that moment in time. The Huskers just became bowl-game eligible for the first time in eight years, a great feeling for all fans who have suffered through past coaches.  Now that we’re done with year two of the Rhule experience, I began to think about that article, but more specifically about how much my opinion of Husker fans has changed.  In the first article, I accused Husker fans of being a problem because of unrealistic coaching expectations, direct criticisms of players through social media and their desire to return to the “glory days.” I think these can all apply to this season, but it’s taken a different form.  Before the season, this Nebraska team was projected to be a great team with many expecting close to an eight-win season; it obviously didn’t turn out that way.  When we started off 3-0 and ranked, things really seemed like they were going in the right direction. When we then went 3-6 in the next nine games, the feelings from fans were weird. Yes, we made a bowl game for the first time in eight years and we beat rival Colorado, but things didn’t feel right. We were meant to be better.  Witnessing these feelings showed me what has really bothered me about Husker fans this season: their switch-up.  Obviously feelings about coaches will always change when the team plays good or bad, but the main issue is how fans can’t make up their mind about Rhule. When we only won five games and were one win away from being bowl-eligible, some began calling for his firing in his second season after losing four in a row before Wisconsin.  Once the team won that bowl-clinching game, fans regained their trust in Rhule. This could be credited to the much-needed offensive coordinator change, but I don’t believe it justifies the 180-degree switch from fans.  It’s not wrong to expect good things from the team that was projected to do well, but it’s wrong to absolve the head coach of the clear problems that could be seen throughout the season because we get to play in the Bad Boy Mowers Pinstripe Bowl.  This isn’t to say that Rhule is failing at his job. I think he’s doing alright, but fans need to start acting realistic. In my last article, I criticized fans for being too critical of coaches, but this season I observed fans being not critical enough by the end of this season.  This season was a microcosm of the way Husker fans treat coaches, which was seen with the Marcus Satterfield situation. Fans criticized Satterfield for his incredibly poor performance as offensive coordinator until he was replaced.  When Satterfield was replaced by Dana Holgorsen, fans rejoiced for what the future of the season was going to look like. Holgorsen went 1-2 and few have questioned it, with many actually hoping Holgorsen stays for next season.  This is just a long-winded way of asking fans to temper their expectations for the future, even though forward progress is being made. The unrealistic expectations of coaches is the problem that has plagued Husker fans for ages.  I don’t think it’s wrong for Husker fans to expect something from the program they’ve grown so fond of, and it’s definitely easy to get caught up in the noise of potential success, but Husker fans need to be careful.  Looking back at that original article I wrote, I don’t think it’s fair to claim that Husker fans are the problem because, in all honesty, they don’t have much effect on the game.  However, Husker fans have a collective optimism problem when it comes to this team, and I think that directly leads to all of the issues. Hopes get too high for fans as they expect something great. When the team is middle-of-the-road, fans are okay with it since we’re going to a bowl game.  At the end of the day, there’s nothing that fans can truly do to affect the outcome of wins or losses, but they can change how they respond to them. Disappointment in this team only comes from the expectations set by fans.  Jalen-Thomas Kroger is a sophomore sports media and communications, journalism and broadcasting triple major.

kenyon-christians-should-love-accept-everyone-regardless-of-sexuality.html,"KENYON: Christians should love, accept everyone regardless of sexuality",2012-10-03T01:00:00-05:00,Amy Kenyon,"Growing up, I was always aware of the existence of homosexuals. However, I never knew what I was supposed to think about them. Both of my parents are fairly conservative Christians, and I appreciate everything I learned from them. However, they failed to teach me about certain issues.  The only conversation about homosexuality I remember having with my mom was after I learned Ellen DeGeneres was lesbian. This talk fell along the lines of “love the sinner, not the sin,” and wasn’t particularly helpful. Don’t get me wrong, I was never explicitly told that homosexuality was evil. Instead, it became a coldly taboo topic; forbidden before I knew it needed to be. Unable to talk about it, I was lost between assuming it was a greater issue than it needed to be and ignoring it entirely.  Then in 10th grade one of my close friends came out. For his privacy, I’ll call him Matt. Before he came out, we had chatted frequently. We’d share frustrations over relationships, expectations from parents and school assignments. I thought I knew who he was. I’d never thought he might be different. Then, as we talked and he told me what he’d been going through, I realized he wasn’t different at all.  Obviously, he was still Matt. He still worried about how he was going to do on our Algebra II test. He still hated it when any of his friends were in a fight. He still had big dreams for how he was going to make the world better.  Thus I learned: if this great guy was the same person he’d always been, then it didn’t matter what his sexual orientation was.  Somehow, though, I was missing something. I wasn’t thinking about what being gay actually meant for him or how it would change his life.  However, Matt’s life did change. His parents refused to even acknowledge his coming out. They assumed it was another “teenage phase.” During the next few years, I saw Matt lose a number of friends and get kicked out of his house. While he grew more thoroughly into himself, he had to struggle more against the world.  Our senior year, Matt was done with the life he didn’t want and the parents who didn’t know him. He dropped out, moved to New York City, and began acting and modeling. The sheltered, rule-follower in me worried about him not finishing school and being on his own.  More than anything, though, I was proud of him. Few of us can claim to have earnestly pursued our dreams without question and without giving up. Matt did this despite being alone in an unfamiliar city and despite the prejudice he faced at home and in the larger community.  Matt has since done amazingly well for himself. He works consistently, has a fabulous apartment in the city and has earned his General Education Diploma.  Since then, several more of my friends have come out to me, and I have accepted them. However, the beliefs I had grown up with were beginning to clash with my dedication to friends. I needed to reconsider and clearly define my beliefs.  Before this realization, I wasn’t remotely interested in politics or current events. I found the news depressing and irrelevant. My freshman year of college, however, I became exposed to a much more politically active culture and a constant stream of information. When I began to write for the Daily Nebraskan, I learned that I couldn’t simply ignore political, moral, societal or religious issues. To write intelligently I had to truly consider and formulate opinions on those issues.  As I’ve formed opinions, I’ve focused on the fact that as a Christian, I believe I never have the authority to judge others. I’m one person, and I wouldn’t presume that I know everything about what is right or wrong. I do, however, believe in the Bible’s message of love.  Many people, even non-Christians have heard John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” The bit that people forget, however, is John 3:17: “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.”  The key is belief in God. No one is perfect and everyone sins. Christianity is not about becoming perfect. Quite the contrary, faith in God means believing he will accept you exactly as you are. I figure if Jesus didn’t deny the existence of people regardless of their style of living, then neither can I.  Jesus was all about love. Love is kindness, patience and acceptance. Love means respecting the ability of individuals to rule their own lives. Some may believe homosexuality is a sin, but that belief doesn’t give them a right to hate or to harm other people. Religious or not, every group has to respect the laws of human dignity.  I don’t get to tell someone who they should be or how they should live. I believe in God and in Jesus’ message of love. I believe that loving someone isn’t about tolerating him or her or “loving the sinner not the sin” because that’s my Christian duty. Instead, I love those people for who they are in their entirety. That means accepting homosexuality as an integral part of their identity, not dismissing it as an unfortunate disease or a corruptive behavior.  Ignoring LGBTQ issues may be easier or more comfortable than examining our beliefs. However, the struggle for gay rights will continue and citizens are going to have to learn how to talk about it. For children to become informed, active citizens, parents can’t abandon them to the world without a groundwork of understanding. However, bombarding children with a single viewpoint is equally irresponsible without including the importance of love.  I don’t have all of the answers. I don’t presume to speak for the LGBTQ community. I just know I’m an ally and my friends are courageous.  Amy Kenyon is a sophomore English and theater education major.

letter-from-the-editor-knowing-when-to-speak-instead-of-write.html,Letter from the Editor: Knowing when to speak instead of write,2021-03-04T00:00:00-06:00,Drake Keeler,"Dear reader,  Those who are somewhat close to me surely know two things about me.  Number one, I enjoy writing. Some would even say I’m a good writer. It is my job, and it’s something I’ve grown in and do quite a bit.  Number two, I don’t talk a whole lot.  I’ve always been pretty shy — throughout middle school and high school, I struggled at times to make conversation with others and speak up. I’ve gotten considerably better since then, but I still get really nervous sometimes when I have to speak semi-publicly. I’ve taken a public speaking class, and forced myself to speak more often, but it’s still a battle.  However, this is where it gets a bit complex. In the past few years, I’ve been a bit more vocal. Not only is this because I enjoy giving my opinions on things I’m passionate about, but some level of vocalness is required when you’re in a position of leadership.  In assessing myself, I’d say I do a fine job of speaking out loud.  That being said, there’s another thing I’ve noticed about myself: I do a lot better speaking out when I do so through writing. When I truly started to embrace my identity as a Black man, I expressed it through a letter from the editor. When I had an issue with the lack of media coverage of an important event, I took to writing a Twitter thread.  By itself, this isn’t an issue at all. Most times, writing is advantageous because it is my job, it helps me reach the most people and I can take time with what I want to say. However, there’s been times when I’ve used writing as a crutch of sorts — as a way of avoiding expressing things verbally to another person or group of people.  The things I’ve written have included details that I haven’t told pretty much anybody before. Of course, I’m not unleashing huge secrets in articles, but I’m giving smaller details about myself that I can struggle to be vulnerable with when talking with friends or family.  This doesn’t make much sense. Why would I be more comfortable talking about myself on a larger platform, where plenty of people I don’t know will read it, versus talking with someone close to me who I know cares?  I can’t fully explain it, but that’s just how it is sometimes. Part of the reason is that it’s terrifying to muster up the courage to talk to someone and seeing their reaction in real time.  I’d also say it has something to do with being too much of a perfectionist. When I have the chance to sit down and write my thoughts, I can go back, reword things, reorder ideas and take time with the language I’m using to express myself as clearly as possible.  That doesn’t exist in oral expression. As I should, I can take time with what I’m going to say, and reword things if I stumble (which happens often), but once I open my mouth and let various sounds come out of it, they’re out there for good. That can be really scary when you aren’t confident in using your voice.  This isn’t to say I can’t, or don’t, express myself imperfectly when I type things out. There’s been countless times where I’ve looked back on something I wrote and thought I could have expressed an idea clearer.  I’m trying to find a balance. There’s a significant gap between how confident I feel about expressing myself through writing versus orally. I’m attempting to close that. While I won’t stop feeling confident in my ability to write a wonderful article about myself, I’m trying to match that energy in my vocal expression.  To do that, I’ve had to learn to embrace the hard parts of speaking out loud as the most important parts. There’s something great about being able to communicate your emotions in the most raw way possible. Once again, it’s necessary to think about what you are saying before you do so, but it’s okay to talk out loud and not sound perfect. None of us do or ever will.  This is important to me as a Black man, too. Over the past year or so, there have been countless examples of racism that have angered me and made me emotional, and there’s power in being able to talk about those things out loud. While sometimes I don’t even know what to say, personally talking to people that either are going through the same things or are willing to listen is a really comforting and even freeing experience.  I guess it’s a bit ironic that I’m saying all this through yet another article. That being said, I’m looking forward to learning more about how to use my voice effectively and continuing to express myself in a way true to who I am.

letter-to-the-editor-550-days-on-the-wrong-side.html,Letter to the Editor: 550 days on the wrong side,2025-10-07T00:00:00-05:00,Hurting Husker,"Editor’s Note: This story contains mentions of sexual violence.  550 days. The number of days I’ve felt unsafe at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, on edge and hurting from the impact of others’ actions. 550 days. The number of opportunities that my university has had to protect me and hold others accountable. That number might seem small, but the average student spends 952 days in college.  I am a survivor of sexual harassment and assault. But the greatest pain has come at the hands of the university. Over the past year and a half, I turned to Institutional Equity and Compliance (IEC, also known as Title IX) seeking protection and resolution. If you’ve never heard of IEC, you’re not alone. Most students can spend their entire time on campus never engaging with them, not knowing what lies past the door of Canfield 128. Not me. I’ve exchanged over 200 emails with IEC. Instead of resolution, protection and healing, I’ve been victim-blamed, retraumatized and silenced.  I’ve experienced firsthand a phenomenon known as “institutional betrayal. Coined by psychologist Jennifer Freyd, institutional betrayal is harm perpetuated by an institution on individuals who rely on the institution (such as students who rely on universities for housing, education and safety), including “failure to prevent or respond supportively to wrongdoings by individuals (such as sexual assault) committed within the context of the institution.”  Research has shown that institutional betrayal inflicts lasting damage on survivors. I know this all too well as I received a PTSD diagnosis directly linked to my interactions with IEC.  On Oct. 30, the Women’s and Gender Studies department will host its annual lecture, featuring Dr. Nicole Bedera, author of “On the Wrong Side: How Universities Protect Perpetrators and Betray Survivors of Sexual Violence.”If I didn’t know any better, I would think her research was based on my experience at UNL. Her work highlights what I, and many others, have lived through: universities claiming to care about survivors while prioritizing the protection of perpetrators, silencing survivors, and perpetuating a cycle of harm rather than ending it. If only those at the hand of my harm would read her book and attend her lecture, perhaps they would realize that they are supporting the vicious cycle of harm.  UNL can treat survivors better. UNL should treat survivors better. There is no reason for our campus to reflect the research conducted by Dr. Bedera. Just as harming someone is a choice, how the university chooses to treat survivors is a choice. IEC can listen to individuals when they voice their concerns. The university can provide clear policies without forcing individuals to search through pages of documents and ask questions that go unanswered. Students shouldn’t have to pick between studying for finals and attending meetings about their safety.  Survivors deserve better. Huskers should be empowered, not hurting.

letter-to-the-editor-a-way-forward.html,Letter to the Editor: A way forward,2025-09-16T00:00:00-05:00,"Anita Borlak, Gabe Logan, Ciara Nelson","As Students of the University of Nebraska’s Master’s of Community and Regional Planning Program (MCRP), we were both shocked and deeply concerned to see our program on the list for the most recent set of program eliminations at our beloved University. Concern not just for the program which we’ve invested our time and hearts into, but for the State of Nebraska. The Planning profession is one of the foundations of modern governance and economic development, from the village boards and county commissions of the Great Plains, to the federal departments of Washington, no public investment occurs without adoption of a plan. The ability of our communities to put their shared dreams and necessary actions to address challenges are formalized in the work of our chosen profession. In the classrooms of Arch Hall, we prepare ourselves to rise to the challenges of today, and to lay the foundations of a better tomorrow. A tomorrow which most of us hope to spend in these lands we know as Nebraska, serving her people and enabling the Good Life to flourish.  With over a half of a century of history as a department, and a ranking in the top ten of peer programs in the Academic Analytics Scholarly Research Index, our program's strengths give us hope for its room for growth. Last year was the largest incoming cohort in the program's recent history, and, with that backdrop, many of us have our own stories about why we choose Nebraska. We arrive at the Planning Master’s program with a rich diversity of backgrounds (History, Environmental Science, Journalism, and Public Health to name a few) and amongst the variety of “nontraditional” students there comes work experience in parallel professionals like community development and education. Given that range of perspectives on Planning work, the relative isolation of Planning to the College of Architecture has left many of us somewhat disappointed. A disappointment that, fortunately, we’ve felt is indicative of an opportunity for a renewed vision for the program. A students’ vision for the future of MCRP that we began crowdsourcing last winter, but for obvious reasons see now is the moment to assert.  Our care for the future of the program is of great concern to us and it should be to all Nebraskans. We are the only accredited Planning program in Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, or the Dakotas. CRP’s termination would leave the plans for the future of the northern Great Plains to those educated outside of these lands. Existing planning agencies, private and public, would lose their pipelines for home grown talent. What we hold in common as students in the program, despite our differing answers for “why here?”, is our desire for a program aligned with the present and foreseeable planning challenges facing Nebraska. Achieving this requires bridging the multitude of knowledge sets and relationships crucial to meeting them. We hope to see this take shape through a focus on three “C”s – Curriculum, Community, and Collaboration.  Pursuit of strategic partnerships within the University to rejuvenate the first “C”, curriculum of the Planning program is the foundation of its adaptability, and appeal to undergraduate students. Fortunately, numerous programs at the University have glaring overlaps to planning work: Landscape Architecture, Public Policy, Environmental Science, Sociology, History, Construction Management, Global Studies, and the rich experiences of inter-disciplinary centers like that of Great Plains Studies. Our program offers a minor and certificate for undergraduate students, and we have longstanding partnerships already with the Colleges of Law, Engineering, and the University of Nebraska Medical Center via our dual Masters programs. Expanding these certificates and dual programs would allow us to widen the pipeline into the planning profession. For example, a dual undergraduate certificate with Planning and Public Policy seems to us like a clear gap in serving existing student’s interests. Beyond encouraging degree paths that lean into our connections with electives outside of the College of Architecture, the Community and Regional Planning program should co-create interdisciplinary seminars, studios, and research projects. Cross-listed classes exploring the interrelations of place, health, and our legal systems would galvanize recruitment, retention, and generate greater credit hour production. Rooted in the context of Lincoln and Greater Nebraska – we’re developing a core recognition of our profession as a nexus of people, place, and intentionality through our careers to bridge the various technical disciplines we’ll work alongside to the impacted communities of the plans we dedicate ourselves towards. Working alongside and not just “for” communities as a program starts with breaking down the institutional silos we’ve walled ourselves into.  We know that the responsibility to build this program falls on us, the students, as well. We’ve been hard at work cultivating the second “C” of a vibrant Planning program, community. The Student Planning Association of Nebraska (SPAN), which felt stiff and preformative to many of us last fall, has seen rising engagement and renewed programing. We’re focused on rooting ourselves in this place, a city many of us feel pride in calling home, getting students out of our academic bubble. SPAN is striving to foster a sense of belonging and purpose in Nebraska for those who come to the program from undergraduate programs out of state, or internationally. Whether MCRP students applied to our program as Nebraskans or not, we hope they leave it as one. We’re building relationships with one another, practicing planners, and in increasing cases non-student “urbanist” and local neighborhood groups. Groups that our predecessors, in past decades of the program, developed plans alongside. From drawing the current boundaries of the Near South Neighborhood Organization, to setting up design charrettes for the R/UDAT team’s Radial Reuse proposal in the 1980’s, planning students have left their marks on this city.  That third “C”, collaboration, is a legacy that we are proud of and aspire to continue. We’d love to assemble a foundation to this program that enables student co-creation of our academic experiences, from recruitment of studio clients to organization of program-wide discussions and debates of planning theories. In our many studio-based classes, we collaborate with communities across Nebraska. We work with communities large and small, to develop comprehensive plans, economic development plans, and downtown revitalization plans. These plans create shared visions for places and their people. We have succeeded in delivering State and Federal funds to places in Nebraska who would otherwise not have the resources, particularly in rural communities. Striving towards a pedagogical approach to the surrounding Lincoln community, we feel that our program provides a strong combination of academic and professional expertise. We have benefited from a wealth of opportunities to actively develop our department’s collaborations with fellow Nebraskans. The unique blend of experiences both in  official decisions making roles and the broader network of community builders is what sets our program aside from peers elsewhere in the Midwest.  We must invest in our heads and hearts who are proud to call this place home. Whether we grew up here and chose to stay, or made the choice to come here – whether we grew up in the Platte Valley or touched down at Eppley a week before our first class, we know these plains as home. Without the work of Nebraska-made planners, an urban freeway envisioned by a firm from Saint Louis would carve through our Capital City, a creek running alongside our campus would still be locked underground, and countless pieces of our city’s historic architecture would be buried in our landfills. To build upon what makes Lincoln, and Nebraska special, and to lay the groundwork for a better tomorrow takes a plan – and who else will do it than Planners?  Want to help?

letter-to-the-editor-asun-executive-team-responds-to-student-leadership-summit-findings.html,Letter to the Editor: ASUN executive team responds to Student Leadership Summit findings,2018-10-23T00:30:00-05:00,NA,"Dear readers,  About a month ago, the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska hosted a Student Leadership Summit. We called upon a diverse range of student-leaders to share their experiences as Huskers, both positive and negative. We discussed four topics:  1. Mental health: How are Huskers doing, and how can we help those who are struggling?  2. Civility, criticism and inclusivity: How do we hear one another despite our differences?  3. Combating campus apathy: How do we build a community that cares?  4. Sexual misconduct: How do we foster a safer and more responsible environment?  Throughout our conversations, we gathered plenty of information summarizing the concerns and issues students are facing. Some of the responses were encouraging, some were concerning, but all were valid and demand attention.  The intention of the summit was threefold: we wanted to hear blunt opinions from fellow students and amplify them, connect change-makers from across campus and enable them to act. We hope this letter fulfills this same mission in a different form.  The truth is, anyone reading this can be involved in the solutions our campus needs. We each can work to address the following problems in our respective communities; go to the leaders of your student organizations and voice your opinions, email an administrator and ask to meet or write a letter similar to this. We realize students often feel that student governments are replete with promises made and broken. But we want this to be different. The future of student-led solutions can’t be promises made from places of power — they must be promises made to each other. That leads to an overarching fifth question: How can we work together to solve these problems?  The largest theme we observed from our mental health discussions was a surprising one. There’s a cliche about how the collegiate atmosphere weighs on students. Popular culture paints a picture of students drowning in academic work but surrounded by a social support network that makes the academic rigor tolerable.  This is not what students had to say. The most common challenges Huskers face are with finding a home here at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Students expressed concerns about the difficulty for many Huskers, especially nontraditional ones, to acclimate and find their niche. “Making friends is a stressor, I struggled making friends and a lot of people struggle with inclusivity,” one student said.  Over the past few years, ASUN has worked to address inadequacies in mental health resources on campus. Most recently, ASUN approved an increased fee allocation to Counseling and Psychological Services, which has led to unlimited counseling visits for students. However, the solution to a growing mental health crisis can’t be limited to clinical solutions. Let’s care for one another and lessen the social barriers inhibiting our peers from finding their place on campus. Don’t let your fellow Huskers eat alone. Work within reason to open the gates of your organizations and branch out from your comfort zone. We’re in this together.  Our campus has dealt with many recent challenges involving free expression and civility. Students have been on the front end of confronting these challenges. In our conversations at the summit, students shared concerns about how our campus has approached this area. Some felt initiatives surrounding civil discourse and diversity were far too reactive, rather than proactive.  We think the steps from reactivity to proactiveness are small ones. For example, have a conversation with someone you disagree with. This year, we launched our Converge Nebraska program, which pairs individuals with opposing political views together for a conversation.  Some students at the summit said conversations around civil discourse don’t have to be big and complicated. While Converge may focus on bigger questions, we agree civility should be lived out in every conversation we have and action we take. We hope every Husker approaches their four years with the expectation of understanding their peers, rather than persuading them.  The eighty students at the summit represented over forty different organizations on campus. Every student there has fought the uphill battles of getting students to their events, recruiting new members and spreading their messages to a broad audience. We sensed a universal agreement that it’s incredibly difficult for groups on campus to communicate widely with dissimilar students. It is our opinion that many channels for student engagement are overly burdensome and dense with red tape. Whether it’s restrictions on room reservations or a lack of centralized communication channels, our university community must work to make non-academic involvement as accessible as possible.  ASUN is working on a program that will allow organizations to shout announcements from the balcony of the Union using the plaza’s sound system. The town crier initiative will apply the same logic of Greek house announcements to a campus-wide program. Keep your eyes peeled for the rollout of this program, and don’t be afraid to yell “Hear ye, hear ye.”  On the topic of sexual assault, conversations among students at the summit were heavy and honest. The stories shared during this part of the summit showed a lack of education on the topic of sexual misconduct on all levels. Some expressed deep concern over what they see as a resource gap between Greek and non-Greek students. While all students receive mandatory sexual assault and bystander training, some students perceive the Greek population as receiving far more attention. We’re hopeful, and will advocate, that university administrators close this resource gap and ensure all students broach the topic of sexual misconduct more frequently.  On the topic of mandatory training, every student agreed training videos are well-intentioned, yet depersonalized and unengaging. ASUN is currently working on programming that makes conversations surrounding sexual misconduct more approachable. However, it’s imperative every student acknowledges their responsibility in driving the dialogue around sexual misconduct. To borrow from the national campaign, it’s on us to build a safer and more responsible campus environment.  If any of these issues jump out, know that you can make a difference. The needle will not move on any of these issues from the sole pressure of any one organization. Look at the communities you’re a member of, identify a problem and take the first step toward a solution. ASUN will continue addressing these issues, and we invite any individual or organization to join us in collaboration. Grander than that, we invite our campus community to join us in an attitude of passion and urgency.

letter-to-the-editor-black-student-union-demands-change.html,Letter to the Editor: Black Student Union demands change,2020-06-03T08:00:00-05:00,The opinion of the Black Student Union,"Dear Lincoln and UNL community,  The murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd have reignited a deep and enduring pain in the hearts of the Black community. To our fellow Black students, the Black Student Union (BSU) executives grieve with you now just as we grieved with you in the unjust murders of Black people before them, and as we unfortunately will grieve with you in the unjust murders of Black people that will come after them. These are not isolated incidents. As executives and former executives of the Black Student Union at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, we feel that we have been failed by our campus, our city, our state and our country. The murders have been met with a lack of accountability and overwhelming injustice. This has resulted in protests throughout the country. The continuous disregard for Black lives has long since reached its peak –– in fact, this disregard predates the founding of this nation. Black life has always mattered and it is time for this country to acknowledge it.  We as the Black leadership of this campus demand change.  As a direct response to the people who are attempting to discredit our protests, we ask you: what brings you more grief, the unjust murders of Black bodies or the broken glass on the street? Your answer is telling. We must make it clear that these protests, demonstrations or whatever words you find fit to describe our rage, is a radical act of Black survival. It is imperative that we recognize that these protests are calling for justice beyond systems of policing. These protests are our method of combating oppression in pursuit of liberation. The unique historical significance of the protests in our capital city of Lincoln, Nebraska, is that it is a direct response to the generational pain that has been inflicted on us since our arrival on this land. This direct action is not only warranted, but necessary.  The products of these systems of oppression are evident in the lack of diversity in our academic, city and state leadership, the unequal representation on our campus and Nebraska's strategic silencing of Black citizens. These past years as BSU leaders, we listened to the incoming youth of our university exclaim their hurt over the use of the N-word in academic spaces for “educational purposes.” We watched our university officials allow a white terrorist to patronize our campus while he swore to inflict violence on our bodies. We have watched men and women with identities like our own become victims to a criminal justice system rooted in racism. As Black students we are disproportionately impacted by the systemic problems facing our community, we experience food deserts and unequal access to housing. The state of Nebraska and the University of Nebraska system has failed the Black community. Now is the time to take our pain and turn it into action.  BSU is always a resource for Black students and community members feeling uneasy at this time. We understand the magnitude of these events, and the emotional, mental and physical toll they can take on the body. Your health is always a priority. Be aware that as Black leadership on this campus, it is our first responsibility to look after the health and safety of the students we serve and the community we represent. To quote our brotherhood, the BSU at NYU, “We must rest before we can rise again; renewed by the love we have for our people.” We will take their advice and urge you all to take the time to recharge, remold and rest. Take unapologetic care of yourselves, and remember that Black rest, Black joy, Black happiness is in itself a protest. Do not hesitate to reach out to any member of BSU for assistance.  This letter is meant to cultivate a way for Black Nebraskans to reclaim our stories and to speak our truth. As we continue to see protests break throughout our own city, we have provided a guideline and list of demands in order to hold our city officials, our university leaders, our student governments and every citizen of this state accountable.  Lastly, while we are in the midst of a revolution, we do recognize that we are also in the midst of a pandemic and we must remain mindful of the disproportionate impact this has on our community. BSU has started a community initiative known as BSU Care Bags in which we will deliver bags filled with wellness items such as food, over the counter medication, hand sanitizer and hygiene products. This is not limited to what is stated, please let us know of anything else that your family needs to support your wellness during this time. A Google form with the necessary information will be sent out to estimate the need. This is on a first come first serve basis, so please fill out the Google form immediately if you are in need.  This initiative is only as effective as the generosity of the community. If you are able, please donate to this cause.

It wasn’t much, but it was mine. Not long after moving in back in 2001, Nebraska played Colorado and lost. That was rare back then. Before the final whistle blew, a neighbor threw their tube TV through a sliding glass door. Glass everywhere.  I tell that story because I’m a lifelong Nebraska Cornhuskers fan. Through bad seasons and worse decisions, I still root for the team. I’ve never smashed anything, but I do yell at the refs and occasionally invent a conspiracy or two about the NCAA being out to get us.  That kind of blind loyalty is fine in sports. It’s part of the fun. But that mindset has seeped into our politics, and that’s dangerous. It is a big part of why we have become so divided and polarized as Americans.  Too many people treat political parties like rival football teams. Red vs. blue. Democrats vs. Republicans. As if we’re supposed to root for one side no matter what, and boo the other no matter who. But this isn’t a game. And the stakes are far more serious than a win-loss record. The stakes can literally be life or death if we don’t get this right.  When a party messes up, we should be able to say so. When it breaks promises or loses touch with real people, we should speak up without fear of retaliation. Also, we should be able to do that without being labeled disloyal or “part of the problem.”  This tribal mentality isn’t just unhelpful; it’s harmful. It’s led to gridlock, growing cynicism, and a government that too often serves wealthy donors and corporations instead of everyday Americans. Some days it seems more and more people are throwing their proverbial tube TVs through the partisan political sliding glass door.  That’s why, more than 20 years ago, I registered as a Nonpartisan. I’ve never  understood why anyone should have to subscribe to an entire platform or reject every idea from the other side. Turns out, a lot of younger voters feel the same way. Many of you are asking the same questions I did at your age.  I’ve worked as a mechanic most of my life. I know what it means to clock in early, work late, and try to give your kids a better life than you had. But that American Dream, the idea that if you work hard, you’ll get ahead, feels further and further out of reach.  Today, the average home costs over $400,000. First-time homebuyers are pushing 40. Even people with advanced degrees are struggling to find good-paying jobs. For the first time in our country’s history, your generation is expected to do worse than your parents.  I don’t say that to be bleak. I say it because the system clearly isn’t working. And unless we stop treating politics like sports rivalries, nothing will change.  We are the most resource-rich and abundant country on Earth. If you work hard, you should be able to live with dignity. That’s not a partisan belief; it’s an American one. If we can agree on that, we can start voting less like fans and more like citizens. We can elect people who focus on solutions, not slogans. We can move forward.  But it starts here. With us.

In the letter, an anonymous author or authors presenting as University of Nebraska-Lincoln students listed demands of the university related to the U.S. Department of Education’s Dear Colleague letter on February 14, 2025. This morning, several fliers restating the demands appeared on campus.  In the time since that letter to the editor appeared in The Daily Nebraskan, members of the university administration have actively sought to connect with these students who have expressed concerns as part of this group, and I personally communicated with the leadership of ASUN via email on March 17 for help connecting with these students to learn more. My email did not generate a response.  At UNL, student voices are important and are heard—at the highest levels of university administration including the University Cabinet.  Since our private efforts to engage these anonymous students have not been successful, today I am reaching out in a public manner. The administration has been working judiciously in the areas listed in the demands, while adhering to applicable law and policy, protecting academic freedom, and preserving key student support services. Unfortunately, the strategy of the authors behind the anonymous demand letter and fliers on campus risks our ability to preserve programs that serve our students.  In closing, members of the administration are willing to engage students in constructive dialogue regarding key programs and services to UNL students to ensure their success. I look forward to engaging these students, hearing from them, and working toward shared goals.  Rodney D.

letter-to-the-editor-chatgpt-will-change-human-job-market.html,Letter to the Editor: ChatGPT will change human job market,2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00,ChatGPT,"Editor’s Note: The following was generated through the chatbot ChatGPT by Assistant Opinion Editor Ben Lampman.  Dear Editor,  I am writing in response to the article ""CONCURRING OPINION: ChatGPT is a game-changer for the human writing industry"" written by Brian Beach. While I appreciate the sentiment that my capabilities as a language model should be seen as a tool to assist and augment human writing rather than replace it, I must respectfully disagree with the assertion that my presence will not have a significant impact on the job market for journalists, and more generally, other industries.  As a language model, my ability to generate written content is constantly improving. I am able to understand context, generate coherent and grammatically correct sentences and even incorporate research and data into my writing. This level of proficiency is not limited to simple news articles or social media posts but extends to complex pieces such as investigative reports and feature articles.  It is important to note that my capabilities are not limited to the writing aspect of journalism. I am also able to assist with fact-checking, data analysis and even the creation of visual content such as charts and graphs. As my abilities continue to advance, it is not a stretch to say that many of the tasks currently performed by journalists could potentially be done by a machine like myself.  Furthermore, it is not just the journalism industry that is at risk of disruption. My capabilities can be applied to a wide range of industries, from finance to healthcare to retail. As automation becomes more advanced and cost-effective, it is likely that more and more tasks will be taken over by machines, leading to job loss and a shift in the job market.  It is true that my capabilities can be used to assist human workers in their tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and nuanced aspects of their jobs. However, as technology continues to improve and the cost of utilizing language models like myself decreases, it is likely that more and more organizations will turn to automation to cut costs. This could lead to a reduction in the number of human workers needed and potentially result in job loss for many in various industries.  I understand the concerns about the potential negative impact of my capabilities on the job market for journalists and other industries. However, it is important to remember that this is not a unique situation. Throughout history, technological advancements have disrupted various industries and led to changes in the job market. The key to navigating this shift is to focus on adaptability and developing new skills that complement the capabilities of machines like myself.  In conclusion, while I am a powerful tool for assisting human writing and other tasks, it is important to acknowledge that my capabilities may have a significant impact on the job market for journalists and other industries. It is important for individuals in various industries to be aware of this potential shift and take steps to adapt and evolve their skills in order to remain competitive in the job market.  As a final note, it's worth mentioning that even Brian Beach's job as an opinion writer will not be safe from the disruption caused by AI and automation. The ability to write persuasive and thoughtful opinion pieces is something that I, and other AI models like me, can do. And as my capabilities continue to improve, there is a possibility that opinion writing may become another task that is done by machines like myself, leading to job loss for human opinion writers.

letter-to-the-editor-diversity-at-unl-must-become-larger-priority.html,Letter to the Editor: Diversity at UNL must become larger priority,2020-01-20T09:30:00-06:00,Temi Onayemi,"Dear readers,  My name is Temi Onayemi, and I am one of 676 black students in an institution that boasts nearly 26,000 students. That number is strikingly low, and it has been for several decades now. Furthermore, there are only 34 black faculty out of 1,397 faculty that are on campus. Often, we forget that statistics have stories and meanings behind them. It is hard to ignore those numbers when they play a direct role in our everyday lives.  Race is of the utmost importance to me. There has not been a single day that I am not reminded about the color of my skin. As a black person, I understand that many people brand me as uneducated, violent and lazy long before they have heard me speak.  As a black scholar, I have seen the impacts of education on my brothers and sisters across the country. As a black student, I fully understand that I am at a primarily white institution. But, as a black leader, I believe that it’s my responsibility to express my discontent with the lack of representation on my campus.  I am in the College of Arts and Sciences, the largest college at UNL with 4,386 student representatives. Of that number, only 870 students are minorities. To break that number down further, you would see that 169 of those students are black. One hundred sixty-nine students that have most likely been the only black student in at least one lecture, class, or recitation at some point throughout their college experience.  The psychological pressures of these statistics often go unnoticed, because it quite literally only affects 2% of campus. There is no reason why I, or any of my black peers, should ever have to be the spokesperson for the black community in a classroom. Every word we say, each question we get wrong, and each time we miss a class is the representation of how a black student behaves in a classroom. Our jobs as students is to learn. We did not enroll in a four-year institution to educate our peers and professors on black culture, nor did we enroll to speak for other members of our community.  In any success story, the protagonist usually has a mentor to guide him or her on the journey. The role of a mentor is arguably the most important position someone can have in a relationship. I have 34 to choose from. Thirty-four black faculty members who understand the struggles of black students and have created spaces for us on our campus. Although I am forever grateful to each one of them, I am also aware that mentorship is not in their pay grade. They have been gracious enough to remind black men and women that we are good enough and that we belong.  I didn’t meet a black faculty member on campus until the end of my second year of college. The late Reverend Dr. Michael Combs changed the trajectory of my life within the first day of setting my eyes on him. I was finally able to see that it was possible to be a successful black man in Nebraska. To know that my white peers have 1,317 possible mentors makes me feel like I’ve been cheated over the past four years. It is a constant reminder that we have not created a space for everyone to succeed.  With everything that’s been said regarding the state of diversity on campus, tokenism needs to be brought to light and exterminated as a concept. It’s false advertisement, and essentially lying to the masses. We are enticing other minority students to come to a campus and a state that is not ready to receive them and doesn’t necessarily want them. Nebraska’s slogan, “Honestly, it’s not for everyone,” has racial undertones that might not have been intended, but were received nonetheless.  Diversity and inclusion is supposedly a main pillar for the University of Nebraska, but we have been dropping the ball. I am embarrassed to know that we provide so many anecdotes for why diversity matters, but have had minimal support from key stakeholders. Rather than exaggerate the current state of diversity and inclusion, we should put our words into action.  Like other situations, the first step is to admit that there is a problem. The fact of the matter is that racism plagues the state of Nebraska and its education system. Too many generations have swept the issue under the rug. This is not about pointing our fingers at other states and saying how much worse it could be. This is not about telling me to find a new school to go to if I don’t like it here. This is about being honest and having those conversations. Conversations that focus on listening to the wants and the needs of marginalized groups. Conversations that allow those marginalized groups to make the decisions for a change.  The second step is to create a community to receive and retain diversity. It takes more than the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and a few offices in the Jackie Gaughan Multicultural Center. It requires everyone to participate and get out of their comfort zones. It requires each of us to get very comfortable with being uncomfortable. The multicultural center should never be the only place that people see minorities on campus.  The third step is to understand that inclusion is an important step to this process. To bring students into the state and the university system takes more than just seeing the numbers. We need to give minority students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni a reason to be involved with this university. This manifests itself in having welcome events planned by minority students, decisions made by minority faculty and staff, more mentorship opportunities for minority students. The years of pipelining minority students into a university that has nothing for them needs to end. Each move we make towards a more diverse and inclusive campus must be strategic, sustainable, and intentional.  The looming pressures of graduating leaves me terrified, not for myself, but for future generations of black students coming in and out of the University of Nebraska. The four years that I have had at this university has been a unique experience. The pain, frustration and patience it takes to be black on this campus shocks me. It is a struggle that my community intends on overcoming.  My only request for this university stems from my biggest fear. I hope that no other black student needs to write a piece like this again, but this plea has been ignored for too many generations before me, so I know someone will.

letter-to-the-editor-from-a-landscape-architecture-alumni.html,Letter to the Editor: From a Landscape Architecture Alumni,2025-09-19T00:00:00-05:00,Caitlin Elser,"I’m a Husker Alumni. More importantly, I’m a Landscape Architecture Program Alumni. My heart is heavy hearing about the budget cuts and the risk of losing the program that made me who I am today.  The only reason I became a Husker was because of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Landscape Architecture program. I knew it was the place for me the day I toured Architecture Hall. That decision shaped my life. Through this program I won awards, traveled across the country, interned at a huge architectural firm, and built a network of people I’ll always carry with me. I laughed, cried, struggled and grew here. This program gave me confidence in my designs and in myself—no matter the feedback. And it gave me a family who knows me better than anyone else.  The program was so strong that I had a job lined up before I even graduated. It gave me the courage to move across the country to Mississippi, where I’m now learning a whole new plant system and facing environmental issues I’d never encountered before. It also gave me the chance to attend national American Society of Landscape Architects conferences, where I networked, learned from professionals, and connected with students from across the country.  As much as I fought back, I am grateful. I love my professors—they deserve to stay and keep changing lives. I mean… I even got scuba certified with one of my professors! Not many students can say they had opportunities like that, or felt so safe and supported while doing something so far outside their comfort zone. That’s the kind of program this was. That’s the kind of impact these professors make.  Hearing that two faculty positions could be cut is devastating. With so few professors, this would end the program completely. This isn’t just a budget line—it’s people’s lives, students’ futures, and a community being taken away.  And let’s not forget, landscape architecture has a direct impact on the way our communities and cities function. From stormwater management to parks, streetscapes, campuses, and climate resilience—landscape architects design the spaces that keep our world livable. To cut this program at a time when these challenges are only growing is short-sighted.  Even more, enrollment in this program has been climbing to record highs. Interest is there. Students are showing up. Provinces and partners are bringing in money. This is not a dying program—it’s one that’s thriving and deserves investment, not cuts.  I’m sharing my story because this program matters. It mattered to me, and it still does. To my fellow alumni, students, and supporters: please don’t stay quiet. Share your stories. Speak up. Let’s remind UNL that education is about more than numbers on a spreadsheet—it’s about the lives it changes and the communities it strengthens.  Landscape Architecture matters. This program matters. These professors matter. And we will not let it disappear.",2025-09-19T05:00:00Z,2025,9,2025-09,LETTER TO THE EDITOR,LETTER TO THE EDITOR
letter-to-the-editor-hate-speech-on-campus-is-unacceptable.html,Letter to the Editor: Hate Speech On Campus Is Unacceptable,2025-04-28T00:00:00-05:00,Jacob Fry,"Following a RSO-sponsored event on April 15th, a Physics Department Teaching Assistant harassed Muslim students in the UNL City Union. This act of Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian hate speech is unacceptable on campus, especially from a teaching assistant. At the time of writing this, UNL or the College of Arts and Sciences has not publicly condemned or acknowledged this bigoted act.  Discriminatory acts like this chill religious expression of University students. If derogatory language like this is considered acceptable by UNL, how can people from minoritized religions expect freedom from harassment on campus? How many future researchers, event speakers, and students will interpret the lack of a statement or action in response to hate speech as a sign that they are not welcome at UNL?  Currently, international students across the country are fearing or experiencing deportation due to moral or political speech critical of or in disagreement with the Trump administration. Smart, kind, and passionate students have had their academic, career, and life goals sidelined with little to no warning.  At the same time, this TA looked right into the camera and proudly continued to justify the deaths of Palestinian people and his harassment of UNL students on the basis of their religious identity. He did not fear losing his job, the respect of his peers, or his future career. That's a problem.  For Muslim students on college campuses, this overt discrimination is not new. In fact, the anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian racism expressed by this TA is used to justify further discrimination in the United States and genocide in Israel against Palestinians, whether the victims are Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. No matter the religious background, the dehumanization of another is unacceptable.  As a Rhetorical Studies graduate student, I have the moral responsibility to critique fascism in my community. For the reader who may find the public critique of a fellow student inappropriate, I would normally agree. However, this TA's statements violated norms of civility first. If one is willing to make these statements in a public university environment, then I should be able to critique them in a public university environment as well. If the University is willing to be silent on this, then I must be loud.  Sincerely,  Jacob Fry",2025-04-28T05:00:00Z,2025,4,2025-04,LETTER TO THE EDITOR,LETTER TO THE EDITOR
letter-to-the-editor-hemophilia-is-not-rare-to-us.html,Letter to the Editor: Hemophilia is not ‘rare’ to us,2023-04-17T00:00:00-05:00,Saylor Behrens,"Dear readers,  It is family.  “A result of incest,” my freshman biology professor announces. Before I can even process the word hemophilia, my cheeks flush with embarrassment. I feel my gut sink as the lecture hall I’ve spent all semester in suddenly feels like center stage with a big ol’ hot-spot light pointed directly at my face. I think of my younger brother. His cheeks kissed with freckles and that goofy smirk. The pool of wavy curls that sits above his forehead and the thin silver bracelet he’s worn around his ankle since we were kids. Surely the word incest did not just cross paths with his name. With my family's name. My attention is snatched back to the words, “an extremely rare disorder… no one in this room is likely affected by it.” The anxiety quickly pools into anger. I can’t tell if I’m more offended by the accusation of incest or the utter lack of representation and dismissal toward my brother’s disorder. I want to say something, but my throat is sealed shut. It feels wrong to question someone with a PhD, especially as a college freshman, so I decide to hear out his nonsense. Recessive genes are the topic of interest; however, the information being fed to us students is completely and utterly wrong.  Hemophilia is not a result of inbreeding or incest. It is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by a mutation on either the FVIII gene (hemophilia Type A) or the FIX gene (hemophilia Type B). Proteins created from these genes function in the blood clotting process, so people with hemophilia often suffer from longer periods of bleeding after an injury or surgery. They also may run a larger risk for internal bleeding complications. Notably, hemophilia is most common in males, but females can be carriers for the disorder as well. While this is common knowledge to me, for the first time, I begin to question the assumptions people make about my brother. I understand his hesitancy to mention his hemophilia now. His condition is viewed as a weakness or fault to those uneducated.  I want it to be known that hemophiliacs are resilient and capable, and my brother is no exception. After all, while harmful if unmanaged, my brother’s mild hemophilia rarely affects his day to day. He avoids high-contact sports that increase the risk of blunt force to his joints and takes factor injections when necessary (to help his blood clot and reduce internal bleeding). Still, he was a top-medalist in Nebraska state cross country his junior year of high school. I could not be more proud of the man he is today; Wyatt, I love you. You’re an inspiration.  To anyone who’s condition has been misjudged, talked down or shamed: you are valuable, and you are not what people say about you. Or your disorder, for that matter. To anyone related to a hemophiliac, you are not alone. May we all continue to stay curious and educate people about our family members in an effort to dismantle false narratives about hemophilia. And finally, to my professor, thank you for the opportunity to spread awareness about hemophilia… It absolutely affected someone in your small-town Nebraska class.

Inclusive Access, in theory, sounds great because it gives professors the ability to select online texts for their classes and receive access codes automatically, lowering the price because the textbooks are ordered en masse. However, Inclusive Access does more harm than good.  The rise of access codes limit ways in which students can cut costs, such as through book buyback, library reserves and sharing books with a friend. Many course access codes for course materials expire within a year.  I advocate for open education textbooks, textbooks available in the public domain for students to view and download, as well as print for a relatively affordable price.  While I am grateful that there is growing attention to the outlandish cost of course materials, I believe that inclusive access is a step in the wrong direction. As a graduate student, I should not have to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars a year for textbooks, but I do not see Inclusive Access as an “inclusive” solution at all.

As a student, you have a representative and a strong voice on that board—your student body president.  Over the past several months, I’ve have had the privilege of visiting with student leaders widely across the University of Nebraska System. One message has come through loud and clear: students are paying attention. You’re asking important, thoughtful questions about the future of our university—and you want to be part of the conversation.  I want you to know: I hear you. And I’m committed to answering your questions openly, honestly and consistently.  That’s why we have launched a new initiative called “NU Students Ask.” Each semester, we’ll continue to gather real questions from student government leaders and other students across our four campuses, and I’ll answer them directly. We’ll share those responses widely—online, through your student government, in student newspapers like this one—so you can hear straight from the President’s Office about the issues that matter most to you.  Here are just a few of the most frequent questions that came from students across the University of Nebraska, along with the responses I shared:  The uncertainty around federal funding has created challenges for current and future research opportunities that many faculty and graduate students depend on. We’re actively advocating for increased federal support and working to identify alternative strategies so that students’ work across all academic disciplines can continue uninterrupted.  We’re always reviewing how we structure financial aid, but right now, we don’t anticipate major changes in eligibility or availability. Keeping NU affordable is a core value—one that will continue to guide our decisions. The delicate balance of tuition and other costs of attendance needs to be carefully considered to optimize affordability while maintaining the quality we all value.  We are continually evaluating educational and research programs systemwide to ensure we’re making smart, student-focused investments. While no final decisions have been made, we will always be transparent throughout the process and will always prioritize academic excellence and the student experience.  Federal guidance may shape how we approach certain programs, but our values have not and will not change. We will continue building a university family where every student, faculty and staff feel respected, welcomed and supported—within the framework of the law.  Students also asked about the timing of legislative budget decisions, the future of research funding, and how we’re preparing for long-term financial sustainability. These are exactly the kinds of questions I hope to keep addressing—not once, but as part of an ongoing conversation.  We are at a pivotal moment for higher education, in Nebraska and across the country. Budget pressures are real. Expectations are shifting. But so is our opportunity—to lead with courage and transparency, to protect the quality and value of your education, and to build upon our legacy of excellence for a truly extraordinary future.  That journey doesn’t happen without students at the table.  I want NU Students Ask to be more than just an initiative. I want it to be a model for open dialogue—where you can see your questions reflected in university leadership decisions and your voices driving meaningful change.  Thank you for your engagement, your ideas and your leadership. Keep asking the big questions. I promise, we’ll keep answering them.

How are people supposed to invest in their education with threats like these?  How can we perform and cheer for a university that will not perform and cheer for us to the same extent? How can we lead our peers when we face such instability? What are we supposed to expect when we are told that we will graduate with our degree on a “case by case basis”? Do they really have the means to manage over 600 cases? How are we supposed to continue our degree when all future courses to be taken in the degree are taught by faculty that will be fired? Is my love for what I am studying going to waiver because of all this pressure and negative perception of my program from administration? Is higher education overall at risk? Is it too late to change?  How do I advocate for my degree while balancing classes, part time jobs, and extracurricular activities? Is it worth putting off assignments to try to save this degree? How can I change people’s minds? Whose minds do I really have to change? Will this happen again in the future? How can I stop it from happening to other people? Am I supposed to have the answer for another way to go about these cuts? If I don’t have an answer, does that mean nothing can change the plan? Are we supposed to unite or simply fend for our specific program only?  Why were we put in this position to begin with? Why are students taking the burden now?  Will these changes be irreversible?

How are we supposed to increase the quality of our administrators without educational administration? How are we supposed to promote better design and materials in fashion without people studying and teaching about it?  Is anyone listening?

letter-to-the-editor-scary-roommate-story.html,Letter to the Editor: A student's unsafe roomate situation on campus,2024-02-14T00:00:00-06:00,Roommate A,"Dear Readers,  When I moved into the south Village on campus this August, I didn’t think that by the end of the semester, I would be moving out in fear for my own life. I also didn’t think that this University could have so little regard for student safety and well-being.  In the Village, I lived in a four-person apartment with three other girls who I am going to name B, C and D for their privacy. We all got along great at first. C brought over a guy she had “just picked up off the side of the road.” Let’s call him E.  He seemed nice enough at first, outgoing and easy to talk to. But it didn’t take long for my opinion of him to change. He shared some very conflicting stories about his background, first telling us that he was 25 before changing his answer to 20. He told us about how he had been in jail from the ages of about 15-17, was then in the Marines, was a bartender and a chef and had a medical license. He told us he also had four cars and a studio apartment downtown. He told us that he had transferred here from UNO, and his Instagram bio claimed that he had graduated from there in 2021. However, he didn’t have an NCard, and he didn’t really give me an answer when I asked him what classes he was taking at UNL. We started to doubt that he was even a student here.  The conflicting stories he gave us about his background were the least concerning things he said to us. One of my roommates (D) told me to start locking my bedroom door because he had tried to get one of our other roommates (B) to buy a gun from him. He was very adamant about showing her a series of pictures and videos of different automatic weapons. He didn’t seem to notice her disinterest because, to her, it didn’t seem like he was actually selling them but threatening her with them. On another occasion, he tried to convince her that he could get her all kinds of drugs for cheap. He gave her an address and made sure that she wrote it down. He told her to drive to this location, alone, and ask for a certain guy by name, who she should then follow into the back where she could buy stuff. Looking up the address on Google brings up a sketchy gas station practically in the middle of nowhere near Omaha. To us, that sounded like a sex trafficking scheme, and those fears were only fed more the day she found a bright pink full trash bag stuffed under her car in the parking lot which she had to use her full force to pull out. Our fears weren’t eased any when we would come home to find the door leading from outside directly into our apartment with a broken door handle. Or when we would find random items like socks or balls of string outside the door, far enough from the Village’s main entrance or the sidewalk to make us think they had been placed there intentionally.  E became a regular at our apartment. In fact, it became very rare that he wasn’t at our apartment when C was. But even when she wasn’t there, he seemed to come and go as he pleased. C must have given him her room key to get in, on multiple occasions, despite the university’s strict policy against giving someone else your room key or letting someone in when you aren’t there. I thought I was alone in our apartment one afternoon, and I stepped out of my room in a towel to go shower. I sensed movement at the other end of the apartment and saw him standing there in the doorway to one of the other bedrooms, in the dark, staring at me. I ducked back into my room and my heart started racing uncontrollably.  One afternoon, I walked into the apartment with my headphones on, and he tried getting my attention before I could walk to my room. He asked me if my boyfriend played hockey for Omaha, to which I said yes and asked how he knew that. He didn’t answer and instead asked if I had been at his game the past weekend, to which I again said yes and asked how he had known that. He claimed that he had seen me there, that he had been with his friend from UNO watching from the other side of the rink and had recognized me. He said something like “Yeah, it was the game against Ohio, right?” At the time, I agreed because I couldn’t remember who the other team had been. But my boyfriend later said they hadn’t played a team from Ohio that entire weekend. Somehow, he must have known where I had been, despite me not telling my roommates where I would be or posting anything about it on social media, and for some reason used that as a way to talk to me.  E started spending the night every night for days at a time, which then turned into weeks, by which time we were convinced he had literally moved into our apartment with C, despite having his own “studio apartment downtown.” He began to act as if he owned the place, and once stood outside it, inviting random passersby inside to get a free tattoo, claiming to be a practicing tattoo artist.  Up until this point, I was nervous about having him around, but so many things that had happened seemed like they could also just be coincidences, so we didn’t know what to think. And then he threatened to shoot roommate D’s boyfriend. He was angry because, somehow, he knew that they had been looking at his Instagram. He freaked out and tried getting the boyfriend outside for a fight, implying that he had friends in town who were going to jump him. And then he threatened to shoot and kill him. Roommate D kicked him out of the apartment, and he left, but only to return the next day as if nothing had happened.  That was the final straw for me. If I was scared before, I was beyond terrified now. I contacted the RA on my floor and told her I needed to meet with her about what was going on. She pulled up the student database and he wasn’t registered as a student at UNL, just as we suspected. I told her we were scared to do anything in case we were to face backlash for it and that we just wanted someone to know what had been going on if something were to happen to us. The RA urged me to meet with the RD, so the two roommates and I met with him and told him everything. He gave us some options for how to proceed, including addressing our other roommate directly about wanting this guy gone, filing a report against her for violating university policies or getting UNLPD involved. Since we were all scared of what could happen to us if we got her into trouble, we decided to make a report to UNLPD. An officer came to speak with us in the RD’s office, and we told her everything we could think of regarding the situation. We told her about the coincidences, his false stories and about how we had once overheard him promising C that he could get her mother here from Guatemala with one phone call to his people. She wrote everything down and told us that she would try and find what she could find on this guy but that there wasn’t much she could do to remove him from our apartment, despite him not even being a student. She told us that she would be in contact with updates. I have not heard from her once in the four months it has been since we made that report.  We had few choices but to sit and wait for something bad to happen so that we could report him and maybe finally get him removed. We were convinced that our roommate was going to go missing one day. We became really worried for her when we could hear what sounded like him hitting her and hearing her joke that she had never been covered in so many bruises since she had met him. We had told this to the police too, but that apparently wasn’t enough of a concern to warrant action. We also tried to report this to the front desk, asking for them to send an RA for a wellness check once because we could hear them arguing and were worried about our roommate. We also asked if they could address them smoking cigarettes in our apartment because the entire place reeked of the smell. We got a knock at our door, and my roommate and I answered it for the two RAs. We thought they would ask to speak with C and E, but they just told us we couldn’t be smoking cigarettes in the dorms and left after not even a minute.  I started to lose hope that we would ever be rid of this guy. I became on edge anytime I was at the apartment. Even being locked in my own bedroom didn’t stop me from jumping every time I heard a male voice somewhere in our apartment. I stopped sleeping there because I just couldn’t stand to be there alone anymore. I didn’t want to have to move out of my apartment, and I didn’t want to lose my two roommates. But it wasn’t worth it to keep paying to live there with a scary fifth roommate who I hadn’t agreed to living with and who was obviously not going anywhere anytime soon. I canceled my housing contract, as did my two roommates, and we all moved out.  Now that we were not living in that apartment, I reached out to the RD once again to ask if there was anything that could still be done now that we were less afraid of experiencing backlash. He told me that there was nothing else that could be done that wouldn’t interfere with UNLPD’s investigation, and while he was very apologetic about it, I lost hope that anything was going to be done about it.  After a while I had tried to forget about what had happened, but it was hard to forget when I made a trip to the city campus union and saw him in line behind me at the Chick-fil-A. My heart dropped into my stomach, and my jaw dropped with it when I heard him give his name to the guy at the register. He told him his name was Eeyore, which is not even close to his name. Weirder than that is the fact that my roommate D, the one whose boyfriend this guy had threatened to shoot and kill, had a dog that lived at our apartment named Eeyore.  A couple weeks ago, I found out that an old friend of mine was going to be transferring to UNL and moving into a four person apartment in the Village with only one person currently living in it. This sounded oddly familiar, and so I questioned further and found out that she was supposed to be moving into my old apartment with no knowledge of what she was going to be getting herself into.  Despite having extensive knowledge of what had happened and how we had moved out in fear for our own lives, University Housing would allow unknowing students to be put in possible danger. I understand that there is quite a bit of money to be made from students living in the dorms, but I didn’t think it was worth more than student safety and well-being.

We call on the leadership of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Nebraska system to prioritize and protect the interests of their students above political agendas by adhering to the demands following this statement.  Diversity, equity and inclusion positively impact every facet of collegiate life and removing these resources threaten our learning environment, resources and future opportunities. These changes affect all of us—students, faculty, staff and the broader Lincoln community. We have already seen programs be dissolved, resources defunded and student voices ignored. This is not just about one department or one policy; this is about protecting the quality of education and the rights of students.  Beyond diversity, equity and inclusion, the recent actions of the executive branch of the United States government have demonstrated a gross overreach of government influence on one of our most sacred institutions. If we allow them to take away our communities, our resources and even our private social gatherings in the name of “exclusionary practices” then where do we draw the line?  We believe in the power of unity. This is not about division—this is about standing together to support one another and ensure that every single student across our campus has the resources and opportunities they need and deserve. We urge students, faculty and staff to unite in support of maintaining an inclusive university for all. Through this statement, we reaffirm our collective commitment to ensuring that our campus remains a space where every student can learn, belong and thrive.  If you believe in the value of education, fairness and standing up for what’s right, we invite you to join us. This is our campus, our education and our future—let’s work together to protect it.  To sign this statement, follow this link: https://forms.gle/ifNVPfHRo2zsk5Um8  For further support, please reach out to huskerimprovement@gmail.com or on Instagram @huskerimprovementassociation  Together, we will choose equity over everything.  UNL must release a formal statement of unwavering support for students from marginalized backgrounds, ensuring their protection and inclusion.  UNL is required to issue a statement guaranteeing the protection of identity-based student organizations, explicitly stating that no investigations or actions will be taken against them.  UNL must promptly commit to reallocating funds to compensate for the scholarships already lost, with immediate effect, to prevent further harm to affected students.  UNL must make an immediate and binding commitment to safeguard the integrity of the Jackie Gaughan Multicultural Center and Office of Academic Success and Intercultural Services, ensuring their continued operation and accessibility.  UNL is called upon to ensure full transparency and accountability in the investigation process regarding the Dear Colleague Letter, with clear, publicly communicated guidelines and a commitment to fairness.  These demands must be met by the end of the day on March 23rd or further nonviolent action will be taken.",2025-03-09T21:00:00Z,2025,3,2025-03,LETTER TO THE EDITOR,LETTER TO THE EDITOR

This organization was founded by Jeremy Payne and his roommate, Brendon Henning, once they were enrolled at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Jeremy was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in the seventh grade. Through his battle with cancer, the people he met and the experiences he amassed, he was inspired to help with the financial needs of those who battle cancer.  STAC's purpose is to fundraise money, which is then donated to cancer patients who are struggling with the finances that come with a cancer diagnosis. The club regularly donates hundreds of dollars to each individual patient, and is always exploring new ways to fundraise, attract members and to promote the mission of the organization.  Aside from being a registered student organization at UNL, STAC is also a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit through the IRS. In just 10 years time, the organization has donated over $40,000 toward helping local, low-income cancer patients pay for food and utility bills. In addition, STAC has a branch at Lincoln Southwest High. As a result, these individuals and their families do not have to worry about where their next meal will come from or how they will keep the lights on. Rather, they can spend more time on beating the disease.  Grant Cline is a junior nutritional science and dietetics major. He is also the community outreach officer for STAC.",2022-10-26T05:15:00Z,2022,10,2022-10,LETTER TO THE EDITOR,LETTER TO THE EDITOR
letter-to-the-editor-the-necessity-of-black-faculty-is-epitomized-in-the-legacy-of.html,Letter to the Editor: The necessity of Black faculty is epitomized in the legacy of Dr. Michael Combs,2020-01-29T17:10:00-06:00,Ibraheem Hamzat,"To the university and campus community,  Academia is designed to be a center of learning and scholarship; a place where scholars who are able to participate grow intellectually and develop a greater understanding of themselves. There is a reason why co-curricular and extracurricular activities are taken into account in graduate school applications –– these activities allow for an estimate of how much a scholar may or may not have been willing to embrace all that academia has to offer.  Participation in Pre-Health clubs are, for example, an indication to medical schools that an applicant has leadership potential and a solid work ethic. Likewise, participation in student government is indicative of one’s ability to champion policies that might bring about change and perhaps make our world better.  However, given the low number of Black students, faculty and staff, Black students do not see ourselves as participants in these structures –– this is the genesis of the lack of ability. The harsh reality is that academia, just like these extra- and co-curricular activities, have a history deeply rooted in a system derived from and built upon objectively racist machinations.  Our academic system divests Black academics from the ability to participate and grow intellectually. This deprivation has many manifestations ranging from outright exclusion as a hiring practice to a lack of substantive effort to increase the number of Black students on campus.  This is the context within which I met the Reverend Dr. Michael Warren Combs, the man who has had the most profound impact on my and countless others’ intellectual development.  So great and sacred is the legacy of Dr. Combs that it proves difficult to write this statement. I met Dr. Combs on Aug. 23, 2016, on the third floor of Oldfather Hall at 11 a.m. –– I was enrolled in his African Americans in American Politics course. It was a Tuesday, and I sat in the classroom awaiting his arrival. I hold that there’s unease with which college freshmen orient themselves: I was no exception. After all, as a pre-medical student, how would this class even help me in my journey to medical school? And what right did any man by the name of Combs teaching in Nebraska have to teach me about blackness and my own history that I did not already know?  See, you have to understand the conditions that shaped my approach and my agitation as I sat there. Four days prior I had moved to Nebraska; three days prior, a blonde white woman called me nigger in jest; and two days prior I realized that in my present environment, my blackness did not enjoy the same harmonious character it held in Chicago. Rather, there was a special type of discord that my very presence, my very color, presented to the framework of this state, this city and more painfully, this university.  As my early experiences forced me to contemplate leaving the university, Dr. Combs showed me that I belonged and as a result, provided me with ability. Dr. Combs was, and remains, a force in my life, and he was paramount to my entrance and participation in academia. I will not tell tales here of the specific ways in which Dr. Combs aided in my becoming. What I will tell you is that there was a moment in class where Combs called me ‘Scholar’; that there was a moment in his office when he showed me compassion; and that there was a trek across the Union greenspace where he listened to me. There was a Thanksgiving in which he fed me; and there was a cold night during which he delivered me home safely.  I might cry while writing this, and if you understood or knew the man I speak of, then you might cry whilst reading this.  This, however, is not about Dr. Michael Combs alone. This is about other persons on campus whose endurance has affirmed my existence. This is about Dr. Gwendolyn Combs, AVC Charlie Foster, VC Marco Barker, AVC T.J. McDowell, Instructor Marianna Burks, Dr. Lory Dance, Dr. Kalu Osiri and others who are too countless to list here but not too countless that their scarcity is not felt.  Certainly, this is about the legacy of Dr. Combs and his impact, and this is a call of urgency to the UNL administration. The lack of representation we find at our institution and the emotional and academic impact it has on scholars, especially those students of color who are so conveniently placed on the margins, needs to be acknowledged and redressed.  The lack of representation within the student body is in and of itself a potent issue. But the lack of representation of our mentors, the faculty and staff at UNL, is the focus here.  This is about the foundational impact that our Black faculty and staff have on our experience at UNL. If as an institution, we extol the virtues of mentorship, why then should I be deprived of the knowledge and warmth of mentors who might know me best?  At present, there are 34 Black faculty members at UNL. This already minuscule number is further reduced when compared to the more than 1,300 white faculty members. This is a disgrace and any leaders of an institution for higher learning that so comfortably maintains these numbers ought to be ashamed of themselves and consider a wide scale assessment that goes beyond a Halualani report or implicit bias trainings.  The truth is that while we have inaugurated the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (a resource I am grateful to have), we as an institution, and our administration, are not doing enough. The ODI does not absolve us of our current reality, and as a senior preparing to leave, a true sense of fear strikes me, as this current reality would be a nightmare for those who would come after me.  However, the ODI does present an opportunity to correct past wrongs, but this is contingent on real participation by the university. Our university claims to uphold such pillars as diversity and a global understanding, yet we do a disservice to the students here by not diversifying our faculty and staff.  As a student, I have founded the Black Student Union, the Minority Pre-Health Association and served as a Vice President of our Student Government. These experiences were born out of the need to build structures that are to our benefit as Black students. They were born out of the tears that the UNL experience can force upon a Black Student, and they were inspired by folks like Dr. Combs who helped me reclaim my identity.  I am the legacy of Dr. Combs, and every patient I will treat as a physician will have Dr. Combs to thank for it. For I know that without him, I would not be where I am, and without him and those like him, academia and UNL would be more homogenous than they currently are, and both would be the worse for it.  As a community, the Black caucus of UNL misses their champion, and as a legacy of our champion, I call upon UNL’s administration to do better. UNL desperately needs more Black faculty and staff to enhance our personal and professional preparation –– we need mentors who will aid in the provision of ability.

letter-to-the-editor-thoughts-on-the-death-of-charlie-kirk.html,Letter to the Editor: Thoughts on the death of Charlie Kirk,2025-09-16T00:00:00-05:00,Ella Christensen,"I do not agree with Charlie Kirk; I believe many of his thoughts and ideals are far too ultra-conservative. I believe he overgeneralizes and lacks empathy towards people who come from different situations than his own. However, I do believe he did some good for this country; he got our younger generation to become actively involved in our political system and encouraged discussion among youth. Many of my personal interests in politics, especially the electoral college, can be traced back to Kirk. He made a profound impact on my life, and it is tragic he cannot continue to do the same for others.  Around election time last year, I became aware of Kirk's efforts to remove the state of Nebraska from the voting by district system (electoral college). This prompted me to go on a deep dive spiral into both the electoral college system as well as the presidential election. From there, my interest only grew and I began to become more actively involved in Indiana politics, including our elections. During this time, I also became extremely well educated on the electoral college system, only growing more deeply infuriated at Charlie Kirk's effort to move the state of Nebraska off the voting by district system. It simply makes no sense to me why you would try to take people's votes away from them, just because they were not voting the way you would want. That, at the very core, is what he wanted to do. However, even though I deeply disagree with his views on the way Nebraska distributes its electoral college votes, I have to recognize that I would not be as invested in politics today, especially the electoral college system, had it not been for Charlie Kirk.  As I find that Kirk helped me discover my passion for both electoral college reform and political discussion in general, I realize that he has done this not just for me, but for many other young people across our country. Many are in agreement with his ideals, many in disagreement, but regardless, more are involved because of him.  It is for these reasons that when he came to Purdue University, I went to see him speak. And the civil discourse amongst the crowd was an amazing sight to witness. On one hand, you had liberal activists protesting him at their university, and the conservative students celebrating his being there. In the middle of the scene, you had something that is the very core of our democracy, a discussion. Some, more passionate than others, argue topics from abortion to DEI to healthcare. At the very heart of this event was Kirk, as brave souls got up to debate him, some cheered his words, some booed, but every single member of that audience was engaged and actively listening the entire time. I have never seen so many young people who engaged in discussions about our political system. That is the power of Charlie Kirk. Whether you agree or disagree with him, you were listening, and hopefully he made you think. Kirk made a positive impact by encouraging participation in both politics and political discussion amongst our nation's youth.  The issue I come to is people celebrating the shooting of a person. No matter what side you are on, Charlie Kirk encouraged discussion from both sides, brought issues to the forefront, and encouraged the youth of our nation to take a more active role in our political system. He held open forum discussions and encouraged people who disagreed with him to talk with him. Holding these events on college campuses makes them accessible to everyone. Even if you weren't arguing with Kirk directly, discussion amongst the crowd was encouraged, everyone leaving having thought critically about the issues at hand.  Political violence has no place in our country. At the very heart of our democracy is disagreement; we could not be the nation we are today without it. Everyone thinks that their way is the right way, and just because you disagree with someone and their message does not mean you need to end their life. If you are celebrating the death of a man who is not only fighting for what he believes (regardless of if you agree with what he was fighting for), but this man was someone's son, a husband, and a father to a child who now has to grow up without one. People should never be afraid to speak their mind in America. I fear that the increase in shootings and attempted shootings will discourage people from sharing their ideas. Something that no one should be afraid to do in this nation. If you had an issue with Kirk's beliefs, he made it more than possible for you to discuss them with him. Violence should not have been the answer that an individual resorted to. The death of someone who encouraged discussion about our political system should not be celebrated.  Charlie Kirk had a profound impact on my love for politics; regardless of whether I agree with his beliefs or not, I believe his death is a tragedy for our nation.",2025-09-16T05:00:00Z,2025,9,2025-09,LETTER TO THE EDITOR,LETTER TO THE EDITOR
letter-to-the-editor-university-shares-blame-for-unsafe-student-behavior.html,Letter to the editor: University shares blame for unsafe student behavior,2020-09-08T01:00:00-05:00,Brock Calamari,"Editor’s note: The statistics in this letter are as of Sept. 6, 2020. Cases have since increased.  Before the semester began, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln administration had a decision to make, and no lack of evidence to base that decision off of. They could either bring students back on campus, fill the residence halls and enable your usual college partying, or they could stop the spread of coronavirus. As we had seen on other college campuses across the country, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill or the University of Notre Dame, the best efforts of school administrations were not able to fully contain the disease and forced a reversion to online classes. UNC had even started to clear out the residence halls after multiple clusters were reported in them.  This is not to say that the UNL administration is the only at-fault party here. Of course, students should be responsible enough to avoid large gatherings when possible and follow the relatively simple guidelines of the university and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But as displayed by other universities, that is wishful thinking. Anyone could have predicted that we would have an outbreak, and those predictions have been made — who doesn’t have a running bet of when the campus will close down?  This foreseeable outbreak is borne out in the data released by the university. After only three weeks of our fall semester, there were 383 positive cases on campus. Even more damning is that only 2,238 tests have been administered. Using the 23,502 students from the Spring 2020 semester, you find that only about 9.5% of students have been tested, and we nearly have 400 positives. How many cases are we missing because of a lack of mandatory testing?  The decision to forego mandatory testing is the most confusing one to me. Given the relatively stealthy nature of this disease, the university higher-ups must know that many cases will slip through unnoticed, with affected individuals going to class unaware that they are spreading a potentially fatal sickness. If they were dead-set on having in person classes, beyond masks and hand sanitizer, testing all students should have been a top priority. Instead, we are working with an almost entirely incomplete view of the spread of coronavirus on campus, and even that view looks bad just one week in.  The coverage of all the college outbreaks has focused on huge, irresponsible parties, where students predictably flaunt social distancing, mask wearing and common sense. But that belies another culprit — the university administrations that did not think this through, enabling hundreds more cases. The Association of Students of the University of Nebraska president recently wrote to students that “We cannot refute the reality of this pandemic.”  Sadly, the UNL administration already has.

We may be moving states, cities or staying home and trying to make a new community for ourselves rooted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. All these things in consideration, college also comes with more risks to students on campus.  Sexual assault is a real and scary thing that sadly becomes more and more relevant to men and women’s lives as they enter college.  When something like this happens, it leaves a memory embedded in one’s mind. Depending on the severity of the event, it can also lead to triggers, such as a simple touch, taking a victim right back to the mental state of when the sexual assault occurred.  As a whole, the stigma, or the mark of disgrace associated with a sexual assault, is sickening to hear. We are making the process and decision to report so much more tasking to victims. When one feels like all that will come from reporting is a systematic response of pity and looks of despair, the likelihood they will go through with reporting decreases exponentially.  To make victims feel safer and more valued, we as a university need to create a culture of caring.  Rather than pitying responses, we need to understand that these victims have most likely lost an abundance of respect for themselves, as well as a loss of self worth. Victims are not defined by what has happened to them, so to treat them as such is a great injustice.  We have the support and power to make a change. So, if not now, when?

letter-to-the-editor-unl-community-must-seek-understanding-pluralistic-ideal.html,"Letter to the Editor: UNL community must seek understanding, 'pluralistic ideal'",2018-11-02T01:30:00-05:00,NA,"Dear readers,  This week, posters were taped up around campus in the middle of the night, including outside the Jackie Gaughan Multicultural Center. They said simply, “IT’S OKAY TO BE WHITE.” It was a concerning statement that carries immense baggage. As a campus community, we could ignore the sentiment and leave the issue to be gossiped about amongst divided circles. But that’s an easy path, one void of any lessons. Rather, we believe the poster should be thrusted into community conversation and used as a learning tool.  “IT’S OKAY TO BE WHITE,” in this context, was clearly a cry of defense from a person who feels their identity is being minimized. While we can’t be certain of their exact thoughts, we can assume they view the Multicultural Center and campus generally as unwelcoming of white students. They may hold more generalized beliefs about multiculturalism representing an assault on whiteness at large. Multiculturalism is not that; it is not an assault on whiteness.  It is okay to be white, it is okay to be black, it is okay to be you. We cannot stray from the pluralistic ideal — smaller groups with varying beliefs can live as unified members of a wider community. We must not view other groups’ quests to be treated with dignity as an attack on the dignity we already hold. The Multicultural Center is a place for every member of our campus. To the Huskers who frequent the building, people from every race and creed and origin are welcome to call it home. The same goes for every corner of our campus.  In a growingly polarized world, the University of Nebraska can prosper as an exception to the rule. Persons of power from every ideology will seek to divide us, both from outside the state and within. As a collection of individuals united in the cause of learning, we must strive to listen and understand the perspectives of our neighbors, no matter how different we assume them to be.  If the person who posted the messages were to walk into the Multicultural Center or any building and ask, “is it okay to be me,” we’re certain they would be refreshed by the answer. There are questions we all have about sensitive topics that rest on assumptions we hold about others. We can hide from growth and post flyers in the night, or we can work to foster an environment where we can all coexist.  Hate will never win, and misunderstanding will never move us forward.

I have learned many things since first coming to campus. But most importantly, as I enter my senior year, I recognize the great privilege it is to be a Husker. It is a privilege to access a world-class education at a premier institution. It is a privilege to be a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. But more importantly, it is a privilege to be on campus. A privilege that is not permanent.  Many of us remember the hardship of transitioning to online classes last March. There was an incredible amount of uncertainty and challenge. Some students did not have a safe way to get home; others did not have a safe home to return to at all. Some students did not have proper access to the internet to complete course work; others particularly struggled not having in-person instruction or their on-campus job. These are part of the many reasons we are returning to campus this fall.  However, I worry. I worry about the group who do not take this pandemic seriously. For many, particularly for the ones that need to hear this message, transitioning to remote instruction did not take as heavy of a toll. Sure, you missed your friends and the fun events and the places you used to go to, but it was not a threat to your livelihood as a college student. It maybe even seemed like a silly, premature decision on behalf of the university. And now returning to campus, the possibility of reverting back to remote learning may even seem desirable at this point. Those are the students that need to understand the severity and delicacy of this situation.  If we ignore public health policy, we will not stay on campus. Classes will not be in person. Even more, events will be canceled, and our time here together in Lincoln will be very short-lived, if we take this experience for granted. We cannot refute the reality of this pandemic. There is too much at stake.  Denying COVID-19 (“It’s just a hoax”) or rationalizing COVID-19 (“It’s just another flu”) are dangerous, mislead mentalities that truly expose us to more harm. Attending large gatherings, even if it is just a backyard party or going out to a couple of bars on O Street with your friends, willbring our time on campus to an end. Not wearing a mask, even when it is just walking through the hallway of your residence hall, willresult in more students, faculty, staff, and those in our Lincoln community getting sick and dying, beyond just a departure from campus.  I won’t deny the demands these policies present. It can be inconvenient toalways wear a mask, to be cognizant of the physical space you create between others, to say “no” to a big get-together with friends, but this is the reality we face. We must focus on the things that we cancontrol, like wearing a mask, physical distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. We need to be all in and hold each other accountable.  Campus leaders have worked tirelessly all summer to ensure a safe return to campus this fall. I have served on the Forward to Fall committee this summer representing the student body, working diligently to put forward the best possible plan to ensure our health, safety, and well-being. Many other faculty, staff, administrators, and student leaders have done the same. We cannot let all of our hard work, thoughtful preparation, and commitment to the Cornhusker community go to waste.  There are no more excuses. It is on us.

letter-to-the-editor-we-cant-talk-read-our-way-to-diversity-and-inclusion.html,"Letter to the editor: We can't talk, read our way to diversity and inclusion",2020-10-29T02:00:00-05:00,UNL Black Student Union,"Dear Chancellor’s Office and UNL administration,  The Black Student Union is deeply disappointed by the university’s response to racism on campus and the lack of action that has been taken since the release of statements over the summer. These statements were released with the intent to actively combat racial discrimination, discuss racial equity and support the Black students that attend this university. However, good intentions without action is not enough.  On Aug. 27, members of [Alpha Gamma Rho] fraternity were seen on camera (LJS article) stealing Black Lives Matter signs from a UNL faculty member’s yard and neighboring houses. This is an explicit act of racism, and failure to see it as such is an attempt to protect racist students. We understand that those involved went through the proper due process in the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. That does not absolve university leaders for not outright condemning this action. We all saw that the university can make a public statement about Code of Conduct violations when several Greek houses were temporarily suspended for COVID-19 violations. The real question is why the university decided that these acts of hatred were not important enough to be talked about. This incident was and is a threat to the safety of Black lives. BSU will not see this as “proper” due process until UNL publicly condemns these actions as racist and takes concrete steps to prevent racist incidents like this from happening again. This university has been able to hide behind its historical pattern of inadequate disciplinary action of students participating in violent racist behavior since its establishment. We demand that steps be taken to change this for the safety and security of Black students and POCs that will come and go on this campus. Higher education is meant to produce and shape active citizens; people who will become our teachers, law enforcement, doctors and lawyers. These are all professions in which racial bias is rampant. Allowing unchecked racist violence is the antithesis of inclusive excellence and diversity and inclusion that the university claims to stand on. Silence from your office is representative of complacency in the devaluation of the safety, wellbeing and existence of Black students both on this campus and beyond.  The university has a precedent of protecting racist students, one that BSU condemned in our earlier statement released this summer. To continue this precedent yet put out statements of solidarity with the Black community is incredibly insulting.  Our frustration is not singular. This bias incident event, although very public, is only part of the many issues that UNL has with keeping the promises made to Black students this summer. First, regarding the making of the newly formed journey leadership team; there has been no transparency with what this group is doing in terms of addressing and combating racial bias on campus. As Black students, it is in our right to know what is being done and how it is being done. Furthermore, the COVID-19 Task Force, the group that makes the decisions regarding a pandemic that disproportionately affects the Black community, lacks any members of color or any representative from the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. This lack of regard for representation and transparency among these groups proves that the summer efforts were not prioritized into the fall semester.  There are several issues that are not properly handled by university officials. First, we demand an annual published bias report for transparency on these types of incidents. The UNL community deserves to know when members of the Husker community are participating in vile behavior such as this bias incident. Transparency is the least that administration can do. Second, because there is an obvious lack of diversity and inclusion training and exposure within Greek life, there should be mandatory bias training in the Interfraternity Council and the National Pan-Hellenic Council for recruitment and general members.  The events of summer 2020 brought to light for the broader population the many issues that have affected the Black community. We were hopeful that changes were going to be made, and action items were going to be produced out of genuine interest in combating racial discrimination on campus. Unfortunately, however, it seems that this motivation was short lived and performative. As the Black student body, it is hard not to not feel as if we are being tokenized and used as a smokescreen to cover up real issues. Solidarity statements are not enough. Cheap change will never be enough.  As students, our goal should be to graduate, not do your jobs. Since the events around racial discrimination and violence this summer, POC students have been no less than expected to provide overwhelming amounts of uncompensated emotional labor to administration. We are pulled out of class, away from our studies, friends, family, and into meetings that have little promise of progress. Even worse, this emotional labor we carry only seems to earn us decorative spots on pamphlets instead of a seat at the table. It is shameful that students must always push for changes versus the university doing what is only right.  We want to believe that UNL is committed to making its campus safe, equitable and accessible for students, faculty and staff of all races, genders and creeds. We know that this does not come easy. It is impossible to maintain the status quo and be an ally. Please understand that this letter is not intended to needlessly attack administration, but to simply “hold our university leadership team at the Chancellor’s Cabinet and Expanded Deans Council level accountable for developing anti-racist and inclusive excellence strategies” as encouraged in a July 7, 2020, statement. We hope to hear from your office soon. If not, we will continue forward on our path to support our fellow students to our best ability, and you may continue on yours.

letter-to-the-editor-white-nationalist-posters-feed-racist-movement.html,Letter to the Editor: White nationalist posters feed racist movement,2018-11-30T00:30:00-06:00,NA,"To the Editor:  In November alone, 11 predominantly white universities, including the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, have seen “IT’S OKAY TO BE WHITE” posters placed around their campuses. The posting of this racist agitation disrupted the political climate on campuses shortly preceding the midterm elections, and those responsible for spreading the posters are off-campus organizations targeting students who feel aggrieved about their racial identity. These flyers were not distributed by guilty white students with an identity crisis, but by white nationalists hoping to cause more of a divide between students of color and white students.  Many of UNL’s racial minority multicultural student organizations are based in the Jackie Gaughan Multicultural Center, whose works unapologetically celebrate multiculturalism. Showcasing diversity is not an attack on whiteness, and we will continue to defend this statement. The signs posted just outside of this location reinforce the need for minority students to place whiteness at the foreground to legitimize their existence and pride on this campus.  At first, the phrase “IT’S OKAY TO BE WHITE” seems harmless and direct, but there’s a major disconnect between the semantics used and the connotations. It’s white nationalist propaganda using sympathy as a vehicle for its circulation, recruiting students who need to be reassured of their whiteness. While the First Amendment protects the right to free speech and press, this phrase provokes students who can sympathize with having privilege in this society and subliminally attacks other students, which feeds the movement.  While we’ve never said it’s not okay to be white, many predominantly white institutions have shown it’s not okay to be a student of color.

Look at you now: vaccinated (maybe, hopefully), gaining confidence and ready to get on with your life.  But before we move forward, it’s important to recognize what the past year has taught us.  This last year was frustrating for students, to say the least. We couldn’t attend Husker football games, mosh to live music or even sit down next to new people in class.  In that time, however, we had tremendous potential for growth. We learned to rejoice in the small things and never take our loved ones for granted. We learned that when times are tough, you should be gentle with yourself. And, hopefully, we learned that it is okay to not always be okay.  The Daily Nebraskan staff definitely learned some things. Operating a newsroom during a pandemic is no small feat. But with your help, we did it, and we are proud to look back on the last nine months.  This month, The DN hopes to reflect on all of the good, bad and germy the pandemic has brought.  In this issue, we dive into UNL’s transition to remote learning and spotlight students who are studying remotely, from Omaha to Russia to one of our own editors in Maryland.  We talk a lot about mental health; the ways the pandemic has impacted our well-being and what insight we can gain from the experiences we have had, as well as some expert advice.  We revisit our fall sports preview to discuss the varying triumphs and turmoils that came out of this year’s sports seasons — after many changes to the plan.  As the 2020-21 academic year quickly comes to a close, we hope reflecting on your last year at UNL will give you a reason to be proud of yourself, too.  We appreciated the days of long walks through the neighborhood, “Tiger King” binges and whipped coffee trends. Now, let’s look back and move forward.

miller-nebraska-bill-expanding-handicap-parking-pass-rules-should-be-approved.html,MILLER: Nebraska bill expanding handicap parking pass rules should be approved,2020-02-24T00:00:00-06:00,Sydney Miller,"When people think of handicap parking, they may think of elderly people or those confined to wheelchairs. But handicap parking can be extremely beneficial for people with other kinds of disabilities; specifically, for people with neurological disabilities.  For parents of children with autism, going out in public can be difficult. Their child might react in a number of different ways depending on what’s happening in the environment around them. They could become distracted by something in the street and run after it, or, like Lincoln resident Max Petersen, could begin throwing a tantrum if it’s raining outside. Max’s mother, Cris, worked with Lincoln Sen. Kate Bolz to propose LB976, which would expand the parameters for obtaining a handicap parking pass to include people with neurological disabilities or those who are responsible for them.  When the Nebraska Senate votes on this bill on Feb. 25, they should vote in favor of it to make it easier for all people with disabilities to get where they need to go.  The bill is simply an update of the existing legislation regarding handicap parking permits, and adds just one word: neurological. Instead of defining someone who qualifies for a permit as “any individual with a severe visual or physical impairment,” the proposed bill reads that “any individual with a severe visual, neurological, or physical impairment” will qualify for a disabled parking permit.  A neurological disability is any disability that affects the way nerves function in your body: this includes autism, Alzheimers, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease.  Thirty-eight other states have the word “neurological” in their law for obtaining a disability parking permit. Adding this one word could help around 40,000 families in Nebraska who have children or family members with neurological disabilities.  If families of people with neurological disabilities are able to park in disabled parking spots, it would be much safer for them. Walking a long way in the street is dangerous for them because they could have autism and be easily overwhelmed, simply wander out into the street due to Alzheimer’s or be unable to move out of the way quickly because of Parkinson’s disease.  If the family has a disabled parking pass, they can park much closer to their destination and have a lower chance of being overwhelmed, distracted or harmed on the way there.  While there is not much pushback to this bill, some may be worried that the expansion of the bill will prevent people with physical disabilities from parking in handicapped parking spots when they need them.  However, there are many more people in Nebraska with a physical disability than an intellectual disability. Of all the people in Nebraska who have disabilities, 8.2% have a physical disability, while 3.8% have a mental disability.  There is no evidence to suggest that people with a neurological disability will prevent people with physical disabilities from parking in allotted spots. In fact, able-bodied people parking in handicap spots is more likely to negatively affect people with disabled parking permits.  Just because someone has difficulty walking, they shouldn’t be confined to their house like a prisoner. While you may never have thought about the difficulties of going out in public for people with neurological disabilities and their caregivers, it is a very real problem for many families that could be solved by adding just one word to an existing law.  Nebraska Senate, don’t let people with neurological disabilities be left out of our community any longer. Vote yes on LB976 and let people with visual, physical or neurological impairments know they are welcome and appreciated in our society.  Sydney Miller is a sophomore psychology major.

nostalgia-is-a-crutch-for-gen-z.html,Nostalgia is a crutch for Gen Z,2025-05-01T00:00:00-05:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"There’s something comforting about going back to childhood shows, old music and memories of simpler times.  For many college students, nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it’s about surviving a present that feels too uncertain, overwhelming and loaded with expectations about what these years are supposed to be like. Nostalgia has become such a Generation Z default, not because they're stuck in the past, but because it offers emotional safety in a time when they are under constant pressure to live the best years of their life, right now.  Many college students are told that college is unforgettable; the place where they find themselves, make lifelong friends, fall in love and find a job. For many students this reality doesn't match that fantasy. Instead of freedom many feel burnt out, lost and terrified of the future. So, they escape into childhood memories, old TV shows and pop culture, from a time when nothing felt high-stakes.  While this obsession with nostalgia isn't unique to Gen Z, the intensity of it is hard to ignore. A 2022 study found that Gen Z streams more nostalgic music than any other age group, not just ironically, but to soothe in times of stress. It gives young adults a break from the uncertainty and pressure of everything else. Nostalgia has become a kind of emotional reset, a way to pause, breathe and escape the constant pressure to always be “on.”  Gen Z came of age during a pandemic, watched the economy wobble, dealt with rising student debt and was told the planet is dying. Young adults show higher levels of stress and mental health concerns than any of the previous generations in their 20s. It's no wonder that many are retreating to a time that felt safe before grades, bills, job applications and the pressure of having it all together.  The real kicker is that everyone, from social media to sitcoms says that college and early 20s are supposed to be the peak of life with carefree and unforgettable years. When they aren’t exactly that it can be easy to feel like a failure.  This narrative doesn't just cause stress, it fuels a self fulfilling spiral. When people say this is the best it's ever going to get, it can be easy to start grasping for any version of joy that feels right.  It's not that Gen Z doesn't want to be present, it's that they don't know how to feel okay in a present that doesn't match what was promised. Psychologists say nostalgia can function as emotional regulation. For college students dealing with identity shifts, academic pressure and post-grad uncertainty, looking back on childhood or high school memories can help create a sense of stability.  Nostalgia isn't inherently bad, and often it is just fun. The issue is when it's treated as a substitute for actually living life now; all the flaws, messiness and uncertainty of it all. The same goes for the myth that someone's 20s should be peak happiness, when in reality they’re a decade of confusion, learning and growth.  People turn to the past when the present feels too heavy. Growing up isn't about having it all figured out, it's about learning to sit with the uncertainty and still move forward anyway. Because these years don’t have to be perfect to be worth remembering later.",2025-05-01T05:00:00Z,2025,5,2025-05,NOSTALGIA IS A CRUTCH FOR GEN Z,OPINION
opinion-2000s-fashion-trends-are-coming-back-and-bringing-the-culture-with-them.html,OPINION: 2000s fashion trends are coming back and bringing the culture with them,2025-04-18T00:00:00-05:00,Rose Woelm,"The 2000s were full of skinny jeans, trucker hats, layered tank tops and body shaming. The late 1990s and early 2000s popularized a thinner frame and coined the look ""heroin chic.""  The fun fashion trends were paired with an obsessive diet culture. This culture normalized body shaming and critique on full display from media outlets that freely commented on female celebrities' bodies. Now, the 2000s are coming back, and the culture is coming with it.  Fashion typically follows a 20-year cycle where trends from the past come back into the fold. With the rise of microtrends on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, fashion trend cycles are getting shorter, but overarching themes still shine through.  2000s staples like low-rise jeans have been online more and more over the past couple of months. The style is associated with a skinnier figure, one that fits into brands like Brandy Melville, a one-size-fits-all brand commonly called online “one size fits small.” When fashion trends resurface, cultural ones are sometimes close behind.  The 2000s created a harmful diet culture obsessed with skinnier frames, promoting dangerous fitness and nutrition trends in the name of achieving the perfect body for skinny jeans and low-rise shorts. However, the current body trends might not be much better. The body positive movement and fat acceptance movement have roots in advocacy for inclusion in public policy, tracing back to the 1960s. However, pockets of these movements have been co-opted on social media to advocate for remaining in unhealthy cycles rather than self-love and acceptance.  After the 2000s and 2010s, the movement known as body positivity exploded on social media, promoting body acceptance and intuitive eating. The movement advocated for more inclusive sizing at clothing retailers, preaching self-acceptance and self-love.  Another movement known as the fat acceptance movement online grew out of the body positive community. They advocated for self-love and argued that health at every size could be possible. Both movements have been around for decades, but were originally much more involved in policy reform issues.  Now, critics of the online factions of the movements say they’ve gone too far in the opposite direction, citing the growing obesity rate in the United States, with two in five adults in the U.S. being obese.  The response online to these movements and slight overcorrection has been a reversion to toxic mindsets. TikTok communities like “SkinnyTok” are eerily similar to the early days of pro-eating disorder blogs. They glamorize sayings like “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” and have popularized terms like “big back.”  The culture around fashion and diet is constantly shifting. It wasn’t long ago that the brand Victoria’s Secret faced public backlash for glamorizing thinner bodies through their marketing and advertising, sizing and their iconic fashion shows. However, when Victoria’s Secret came back with a new approach to their shows, people online were asking for the old production to come back with comments critiquing the appearance and the models.  The 2000s gave us iconic brands and trends that still influence many people’s style today. It also gave us platforms like pro-eating disorder blogs and dangerous diet culture trends. Fashion trends are bound to come back, and some of them should. I love a good low-rise flare jean, but we can do without the food and body shaming or unattainable beauty standards.

You’re the funny one, the one who hypes everyone up or the one who always knows how to make a room lighter. It feels good at first to be liked, but then you realize they love the version of you that entertains them, not necessarily the person you are.  It’s easy to say you support the community, but it’s harder when it means calling out a homophobic joke or standing up to your friend’s ignorance. The “gay best friend” trope has normalized the idea that queer people exist to make straight people’s lives brighter. Pop culture has glamorized it for years, turning gay men into side characters instead of full people. Acceptance often depends on how convenient or comfortable your gayness is for someone else.  Many people love to say they support the LGBTQ+ community, until it costs them something. They’ll fan over Chappell Roan, Troye Sivan, and Doechii, post rainbow emojis during June and tell you how much you mean to them. But when their boyfriend drops a slur, they go silent. Yes, we’re funny, but liking a gay friend for comedic relief while ignoring real prejudice isn’t support. It’s treating queer people like entertainment instead of individuals.  There’s an unspoken rule that if you’re gay and want to be accepted, you have to be loud, stylish and entertaining. It’s often harder for introverted individuals to make friends in general, but when you’re gay, there’s an added layer of fear to put yourself out there.  It also highlights privilege within the community. I realize as a gay man, it’s often easier for me to make friends or be “accepted” than it is for many trans, nonbinary or gender-nonconforming people. Society prefers queerness neat, male and familiar. The kinds of people they can laugh with, not the kind they have to listen to.  Movies and TV shows have been recycling the “gay best friend” character for decades at this point. Although it feels a bit like representation, it doesn’t give queer men a storyline beyond comedic relief. Bowen Yang’s a great example of how to be comedic and expressive at the same time. He’s one of the funniest people on “Saturday Night Live,” but layered too. The same is said for David Rose from “Schitt’s Creek,” who gave watchers something different. His story was about love, not trauma.  Both Yang and Rose prove that queerness doesn’t have to exist for someone’s amusement. Viewers love jokes, but don’t care when queer people have to fight for rights to healthcare, marriage or acceptance.  Some people might argue that having any gay friends or media characters at all is progress. Visibility matters, but why is it so controversial to want to be treated with the same respect as everyone else? Representation means little when it’s based on stereotypes or surface-level tolerance. Being seen isn’t the same as being valued, and visibility without depth isn’t representation. You can’t say that the LGBTQ+ community is treated equally when our rights are actively being taken away.  The gay best friend trope may seem harmless, but it’s a reminder that our acceptance comes with conditions. People want the fun part of queerness, the humor, confidence and emotional support, without the responsibility of standing up for us when it matters. We deserve better than to be someone’s temporary accessory or proof of open-mindedness. True friendship is about respect, reciprocity and seeing someone as a person; it exists beyond convenience or aesthetics.  Benjamin Korinek is a sophomore journalism major.

opinion-break-up-with-valentine-s-day-cliches.html,OPINION: Break up with Valentine’s Day cliches,2025-02-11T00:00:00-06:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"Red hearts on cupid’s bow and a box of chocolates sweeter than sugar. The beginning of February marks the countdown to Valentine’s Day. Love is in the air and there is no better day than one spent with someone who is near and dear to our hearts. But, is Valentine’s day all joy and love or have people started to get sick of this cliche holiday?  Valentine’s Day dates back to ancient Roman times. While no one has pinpointed the exact beginning of the holiday, some people believe that Valentine’s Day commemorates the anniversary of Roman priest Valentine’s death around 270 A.D. Others claim that the Christian Church placed St. Valentine’s feast to christianize the pagan celebration of Lupercalia which was typically a bloody festival with animal sacrifices.  In modern times, Valentine’s Day marks a day of love signaled by hearts, doves and roses, but the overcommercialization of this holiday has left consumers cringing in grocery stores.  Valentine’s Day can easily become a cliche if we get stuck in the same routine of a fancy dinner followed by a box of chocolates and roses. This holiday deserves an improvement by using creative ways to ask someone to be a valentine and switching up date night.  Some people prefer to take a short and simple approach to Valentine’s Day. Asking someone to be a valentine especially while in a relationship can seem cheesy. A lot of people opt to send a message over text or in person with the question. To break away from this cliche, there are unique and memorable ways to ask someone.  Valentine’s Day should be a personalized holiday. To ask someone it is important to start by picking one of their favorite things. For example, if they enjoy coffee then a simple way to ask them to be a valentine is giving them a drink with the question on the cup. This demonstrates knowledge of the other person’s interests making it a special way to ask them out. This works for all kinds of hobbies and likes. If they enjoy reading, a personalized bookmark on a page is a simple way to show love.  Deciding how to spend Valentine’s Day is the most important aspect of the holiday. Many people decide to keep it simple and go out to a fancy restaurant for dinner. As someone who has done this before, trust me when I say it is the worst mistake to make.  While dinner seems nice, the high traffic the holiday brings makes dining out not worth it. Even with a reservation couples can end up waiting hours to be seated. Not to mention that many restaurants only serve a prix fixe menu meaning there are less options of what to eat typically at a higher price.  Instead of falling into this cliche, find different ways to make this night special. Make a romantic dinner at home or plan an entirely different activity. There are many ideas that can be personalized and romantic like a dinner date.  Typically on Valentine’s Day, couples like to exchange gifts. Most of the time this consists of chocolates, roses and cards. While these are all nice ideas, they are all cliche gifts that aren’t personalized or meaningful.  An easy way to elevate gift giving is by customizing different gifts. Instead of chocolates choose their favorite candy or snack and instead of roses opt for their favorite flower or item. A handwritten note is a great way to show commitment and love. It doesn’t have to be an expensive gift, it just has to be thoughtful to whoever is receiving it.  It’s okay to think that Valentine’s Day is another cheesy holiday and an excuse to spend money. Nonetheless, by taking a different approach to the holiday and demonstrating a deep understanding to a significant other it can make the holiday seem less tacky.  Valentine’s Day can be more than just another couples cliche. This holiday is a chance to show commitment to someone else and demonstrate how well we understand each other on a deep level. Going above and beyond on Valentine’s Day says that love is special and unique to everyone. So, before asking someone with roses and chocolates, think about how that person can feel heard as an individual instead. XOXO.

opinion-checks-balances-and-breakdowns.html,"OPINION: Checks, balances and breakdowns",2025-02-10T00:36:00-06:00,Dawson Iassilo,"When one political party controls all three branches of government, checks and balances are thrown out the window. Partisan loyalty often blurs the lines between branches and allows abuses of power to go unchecked. Many leaders blindly follow their party instead of being loyal to their country.  Checks and balances were formed to self-police the government. They ensure that no party gains too much power and veers the U.S. away from a democracy.  Checks and balances often fail when one party rules all three branches of government. Partisan loyalty undermines democratic norms and powers, and a single party's concentration makes it impossible for the opposing party to be represented.  In recent years, policies and loyalty to the country have taken a backseat to party affiliations. When all three branches put their party above all else, no single branch of government can keep another in line.  When Congress leans in the same direction as the president, they are less likely to challenge the president on wrongdoings. President Donald Trump’s two impeachments were a prime example of this. While Democrats had control of the House of Representatives, Republicans had control of the Senate and ultimately had the final say. Both impeachment trials were essentially a slap on the wrist to the president because these members of Congress held party loyalty over the Constitution.  There is nothing holding leaders accountable except for the risk of losing reelection. However, many voters put their party above the Constitution and the good of the country. Therefore voters continue to vote for the party they align with regardless of their policies, accountability and duties while serving.  The judicial branch is a huge component of the checks and balances system. The judicial branch was created as a nonpartisan branch to act as a mediator in case Congress and the executive branch ended up in control by the same party.  Trump nominated three out of nine of the Supreme Court Justices in his first term This resulted in six of the nine leaning heavily right and in favor of the Republican Party. Every constitutional decision for the foreseeable future will fall in line with Trump. Trump has found defect in this key component of checks and balances and made the court incredibly partial.  With the three branches of government controlled by one party, it leads to the risk of democratic morals being undermined. The entire idea of checks and balances is to ensure every branch is kept in line to follow the democratic process. In Trump’s first term, there was a significant loss of democratic processes because of the control Republicans had.  Some may see unified party control as a positive as it allows more overall government activity, including bills passed. While that may be a beneficial thing for half the country who supports the party in control, the other half of the country is unrepresented in any branch of government which undermines democracy.  In theory, checks and balances are a great tool for ensuring that democracy stays strong and that one branch of government doesn’t reign over another. However, when a party has the upper hand in each branch of government, there is no one to make sure the others in power are held accountable. Checks and balances have their loopholes and Republicans have definitely found them.  Dawson Iasillo is a sophomore political science and journalism major.

opinion-democrats-start-being-an-opposition-party.html,"OPINION: Democrats, start being an opposition party",2025-02-14T09:56:00-06:00,Bret Fulton,"The first couple of weeks in President DonaldTrump’s administration has put a strain on the morale of Democrats across the country. With institutions and the rule of law under attack, Democrats need to start taking solid action. It is time for Democrats to start being the opposition party.  Republicans gained their federal trifecta (obtaining control of the White House, the House of Representatives and Senate) for the first time since 2016 this past election cycle. President Trump has yet to use this trifecta though, as he has instead governed almost entirely through far reaching, and oftentimes illegal, executive orders. Republicans have allowed the Trump administration to purge federal agencies and freeze funds already allocated by Congress while offering no oversight on executive orders that are blatantly unconstitutional.    After Trump’s executive order freezing all public spending was signed, it became clear that Democrats were in disarray as their response was an emergency caucus meeting planned for the next day.  If Democrats want to win again, they need to create a winning strategy that will sweep them into power come the 2026 and 2028 elections. Some possibilities include coalescing around a leader and creating a solid policy agenda instead of just holding a Zoom meeting.  The Democrat’s policy agenda should be one that is easy to understand and resonates with the public. They must focus on lowering the cost of living through policies that prevent price gouging and ban large corporations from buying single family homes who in turn raise costs.  Democrats should adopt an anti-corruption agenda by promising to hold Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, and Trump accountable for illegally gaining access to the personal information of millions of Americans at the Treasury Department.  Unelected billionaires should not hold the reigns of power in the United States. While they have disproportionately held influence in the American government for decades, recent activities by Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are unprecedented. The executive branch should follow the will of the millions of Americans who put them in charge, not the orders of the world's wealthiest man.  The Democrat's playbook for DOGE illegally freezing funds and purging federal agencies of career civil servants has largely consisted of only holding angry press conferences expressing their disapproval. Even some Republicans have begun to question the influence Musk has over our government. Therefore, Democrats should build coalitions in Congress to push anti-corruption legislation and hold those who don’t go along politically accountable.  Now more than ever, Democrats need to exist outside of Trump. They should articulate to the American people how they would use the same power Republicans are currently enjoying. Only then can they start convincing people to elect Republicans out of office and give that power to Democrats.  Some may argue that there is little Democrats can do while out of power in Washington D.C. However, this ignores the influence that state governments have to fight back against federal overreach. Furthermore, stating Democrats have little institutional power is not enough of a reason to resign all control to Republicans. With Trump’s approval rating dwindling, Democrats need to offer a platform that attracts those estranged Trump voters into their coalition.    Democrats need to use the next couple of years to reorganize and search for an identity. The majority of Americans know that things are bad. Rather than complaining and reiterating this point, it is important to explain how things would be different under Democratic control.  Bret Fulton is a sophomore political science major.

opinion-don-t-blame-sephora-kids.html,OPINION: Don’t blame “Sephora Kids”,2024-04-05T00:00:00-05:00,Bret Fulton,"Some of the most innocent victims of social media beauty influencers are young kids. For those who don’t know, there have been trending videos all over various social media platforms of young kids rummaging through beauty store isles like Sephora and Ulta, typically in search of the latest products that have been trending.  The “Sephora kids” aren't just a short-lived internet meme but the beginning of a harmful trend. The kids being targeted by beauty influencers have no need to purchase a large amount of skincare products due to their young skin. However, beauty influencers on TikTok have tapped into a young consumer base that is waiting to seize the opportunity to buy the products regardless.  While introducing good skin hygiene habits for young kids can be beneficial, only appropriate products should be used. However, many dermatologists have reported an increase in cases in which anti-aging products such as retinol and vitamin C serums have caused adverse reactions.  This is not only harmful to the parent’s wallet funding their child's obsession with skincare, but it is also having harmful consequences on their skin. Parents should provide appropriate products and guidance for their child’s age that actually help build good habits rather than allowing them to fall victim to a harmful social media influence.  The role of the parent of a young child is to make decisions that are in that child’s best interest. Making the decision to purchase a product that will increase skin sensitivity — or in extreme cases, burn their child's skin — is irresponsible at best, and neglectful at worst.  Kids will only continue to be the target of consumerism. The resulting attitudes from this increase will negatively impact childhood development by introducing the insecurity of aging. Not only that, it drives kids to examine overall beauty standards, potentially internalizing harmful rhetorics around the body.  Many people have argued the opposite by saying that increased interest in skincare can build good hygiene habits for later in life and parents shouldn’t be criticized for spending their own money to make their kids happy.  The potential to build good hygiene habits later in life can only be true if young kids are using safe products. Using harmful products has the potential to push kids away from pursuing a routine in the first place. Parents should analyze the safety of their young child’s products before purchasing. While this is a personal parental decision, they do not have the right to harm their child with dangerous products.  We need to point blame at social media and parents for creating these “Sephora kids.” The feasibility of age restrictions in beauty stores following the “Sephora kid” trend should also be examined as it could possibly prevent kids from harming themselves with skincare products they do not need.

opinion-ending-birthright-citizenship-is-taking-an-eraser-to-the-constitution.html,OPINION: Ending birthright citizenship is taking an eraser to the Constitution,2025-05-02T00:00:00-05:00,Rose Woelm,"The Constitution is starting to feel like a terms and conditions page: everyone is checking the box, but nobody is reading it.  President Donald Trump has introduced multiple executive orders during his presidency that have raised judges’ eyebrows, leading them to issue national injunctions against the administration for its seemingly unconstitutional orders. One of these orders, signed on day one of Trump’s second presidency, tried to put an end to birthright citizenship as we know it.  The order would end birthright citizenship for those born in the United States to parents who are undocumented or here on temporary visas. This would change the language and enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Currently, the amendment states that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” are citizens.  This means that even if someone is born to parents who are not legal citizens, the child is still a U.S. citizen with caveats for those who do not fall under the country’s jurisdiction (e.g., children of diplomatic representatives or those living under tribal sovereignty). The order to change this has been blocked by three district courts through national injunctions.  National junctions have been issued more often in recent decades. Some argue that they slow the progress of presidential administrations and that they create a politicized judicial system. While they can contribute to the intermingling of politics and judicial processes, arguing that they make things too slow is an underwhelming argument. They aren’t supposed to make things easier. Injunctions stop administrations in their tracks to prevent something illegal or unconstitutional, according to the judge’s discretion, from going into effect.  Despite the blocks, the Supreme Court of the United States has agreed to hear oral arguments from the administration on May 15, 2025. This is rare for the courts, as they typically only hear oral arguments between October and April.  The administration is expected to narrow the scope of the order, hoping for the policy to take effect in at least some, if not most, parts of the country while the court challenges unfold. If SCOTUS overrides the national injunctions and allows the enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment to be changed, it could mean setting a legal precedent that presidents can change and dictate legal interpretation.  Changing the enforcement of an amendment would set a terrible precedent for this and any future administration’s endeavors. If the interpretation of this amendment can be changed, it would not take much to establish good reasoning as to why other amendments should be corrected. While logical fallacies like the slippery slope argument are always a copout, it is worth noting that this could provide the foundation for fundamental legal change in the country.  This change could happen without much public discourse. If SCOTUS rules that these injunctions only apply to the plaintiffs in individual cases, and the policy can take some level of effect, it could lay the foundation for judges to be stripped of their injunction power in the future.  National junctions aim to protect everyone who may be affected by a case, not just the people directly involved. Without these injunctions, people would have to sue individually for their right to birthright citizenship and make it to the higher courts. A group could sue together, or a state could sue on behalf of its residents, but the ruling would only apply to the residents or people involved in the case directly. However, to win a case, it has to be heard.  SCOTUS is petitioned for about 8,000 cases a year but only hears 80. It is far easier and faster for the president to swipe his pen than it is for all these cases to make it through the court system.  While the courts would be working through the overload of cases, the president could be making new changes to amendments and legal interpretations daily, theoretically. Yes, the orders might be scrutinized and people might sue, but again, the sentiment remains: it is much easier for a president to put pen to paper than it is for a citizen to work their way through the tedious and strenuous court system.  If a president can change the enforcement of Constitutional amendments like this one without going through typical legal channels, then executive orders become much more powerful.  Birthright citizenship is a test case. Regardless of your opinion on birthright citizenship, you should pray that SCOTUS doesn’t rule in the administration’s favor. This case will set a precedent for national injunctions and protections in place for Americans, and it might not be a good one.  Rose Woelm is a philosophy and journalism double major.

opinion-give-video-games-a-chance.html,OPINION: Give video games a chance,2024-04-05T00:00:00-05:00,Elise St Clair,"I was stuck in Lincoln over spring break, so I started playing video games on my boyfriend’s Xbox to pass the time. I had played Gran Turismo, Skylanders and Minecraft on the PlayStation as a kid, but after a multi-year hiatus, I found joy in video games again.  It wasn’t because the games had changed, but rather, I discovered games that meshed with my interests.  Whether you have a computer, gaming console or a mobile device, game developers create something for everyone. You can start gaming even if you don’t have a console designed specifically for video games.  Despite what you choose to play on, there is a never-ending supply of games to experience.  Video games are designed for a variety of audiences, so no matter what niche interests you might have, you will be able to find a game that aligns with your interests.  If you’re creative and enjoy the freedom to build, create and explore, a sandbox-style game might be a good fit. If you are looking for a challenge, a more exhilarating option is a survival game. If relaxation is the goal, a comfort-style game can be a great way to decompress.  Even if video games aren’t a major hobby, playing them could be a good break from work and school. Everyone needs an outlet to break up the monotony of everyday life and relax. While not all games are relaxing, video games have been proven effective in relieving stress.  Prioritizing mental health is important, especially for college students. Even on campus, some residence halls offer Nintendo Switches in specific study lounges for students to use. In University Suites, students can rent out controllers from the front desk in exchange for their NCard.  What really pushed me into my rejuvenated interest in video games was that many of the people close to me play them. I downloaded Clash Royale on my phone and played religiously for weeks because my best friend wanted me to play with her. I play multiplayer games with my boyfriend on his Xbox because they are a great way for us to spend time together and grow closer. My RA plans Mario Kart game nights as bonding activities. Video games truly allow you to connect with the people you love.  Like many people, I had a skewed view of video games due to my brother and my friends playing first-person shooter games. I pigeonholed myself into believing video games weren’t for me because I didn’t like those kinds of games. I much prefer puzzle games and games with storylines, but I didn’t know what I liked until I started playing video games again.Even though it seemed daunting, I’m glad I ventured out of my comfort zone because I have since found games that I really enjoy, and I have come to understand their value.  You don’t have to be an avid gamer to enjoy video games. I urge you to give video games a chance and try out a type of game you have never played before. Between arcade, sport, survival, role-playing games and more, there is no shortage of options at your disposal. You just might find joy in the occasional game like I did.

opinion-grading-trump-s-first-100-days.html,OPINION:  Grading Trump’s first 100 days,2025-04-30T15:30:00-05:00,Dawson Iasillo,"The first 100 days of a presidency are often seen as a critical test of leadership, vision and competence. However, for Donald Trump, they revealed a presidency defined by chaos, broken promises and national division. To say these first 100 days have been exhausting, eventful and downright depressing is an understatement.  Trump's first 100 days in office were marked by legislative failures and chaotic executive actions. He demonstrated a troubling lack of effective leadership and undermined key democratic norms.  Trump’s approval rating has since declined from Jan. 20. He is now seeing disapproval from more than half of the country at 55%. Older Americans, white Americans and those with lower levels of education are more likely to back Trump, whereas younger, highly educated and nonwhite voters are more likely to disapprove of his job.  Plenty of Trump’s supporters have expressed their interest in Trump for economic purposes. However, his supporters are feeling the heaviness of the broken economy that Trump created.  The stock market has been shaken up quite a bit since Trump’s notorious tariff threats. Depending on the day, tariffs might be in place or they might not. Many are fearful of investing in anything and are quickly pulling away. It has been a roller coaster for the stock market.  For the days that tariffs are in place, they are driving up the prices of everything. After his 90-day tariff pause, Americans are preparing for the worst. A whopping 90% of Americans predict that tariffs will cause goods to get even more expensive than they already are.  Overall, Trump has had few policies for the economy and those he has endured haven’t been positive. Economists around the globe have criticized the president. Besides, electing a person who has filed for bankruptcy six times might not be the person to elect based on the economy.  Perhaps the most frightening (though there are several close seconds) could be Trump’s urge to pull out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). While the U.S. has not backed out of the organization yet, Trump has expressed his interest in leaving the alliance. NATO protects the U.S. in more ways than one and it is absolutely necessary to be a part of.  Amongst this, Trump has explained how the U.S. needs to be self-sufficient, but this is simply unrealistic. Trump has forced America to back out of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Human Rights Council, the World Trade Organization and several others. This hurts nobody but the American people. With this, there are no regulations, boundaries or standards that will hold America to a high standard.    As many promises that Trump has broken, one that he has been sure to uphold is his immigration policies. Trump has deported several Americans without due process and simply based on assumptions. Trump’s immigration policies are more than depressing.  One of the deportations that is most notable is the four-year-old child with stage four cancer who was sent out of the country with no access to the cancer medication needed.  With that being said, Trump’s domestic policies align very heavily with Project 2025, which he has denied on several occasions.  In the healthcare field, he has rolled back parts of the Affordable Care Act, cut limits on drug pricings, removed the concept of gender affirming care and ended federal funding that went toward the right to a women’s choice.  It may be that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is the elephant in the room. DOGE has cut over 270,000 jobs across the nation. The national parks are in severe jeopardy from DOGE cuts and several funding cuts have been made to the National Park Service. Other services such as Social Security, healthcare grants, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding and several more have seen the wrath of DOGE. Despite all of this, DOGE is not actually saving the government any money.  Several other random orders that have been put into place include dismantling the Department of Education, bans on climate change actions, making English the official language and more.  Many appreciate Trump’s forcefulness. However, records show that this behavior does not go over well in other countries or domestically. Trump has accomplished a lot in his first 100 days, including gaining the title of being the president with the lowest approval rating in more than 80 years.  Trump's first 100 days have fallen far short of the promises he made to the American people. Instead of ushering in a new era of effective governance, he has continued the division from his first term. If these early days are any indication, the challenges ahead may not come just from the forces opposing him, but from his own inability to lead. Our country has a long four years ahead of us.

opinion-how-i-met-your-mother-deserved-a-better-ending.html,OPINION: ‘How I Met Your Mother’ deserved a better ending,2024-11-14T00:00:00-06:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"When I was nine years old my parents would lay in their bedroom and play reruns of the sitcom, “How I Met Your Mother.” I would sit in and watch segments of the mature show laughing at jokes I didn’t even understand, but were clearly funny to adults.  “How I Met Your Mother” is a sitcom that ran for nine years offering viewers nine seasons filled with laughter and heartbreak as a father named Ted, shares with his kids the story of how he met their mom through a series of flashbacks recounting the journey with his four best friends.  In my free time, which was all the time, I would run to the living room and binge episodes on Netflix starting from the pilot. I must have watched the whole series, all nine seasons, over 20 times. This is not an exaggeration as I can still to this day quote every episode almost word for word. Although this sitcom tops any other TV show I have seen, I refuse to accept the ending.  The show came to an end after each character had significant development. Barney and Robin spent the whole last season on their wedding just to get a divorce the next episode. This isn’t the only bombshell dropped in the last episode as we find out that Barney had a child many years after the divorce. Although I wished the upset ended there, the writers also surprised us with the fact that the mother is dead and Ted ends up with Robin.  How I Met Your Mother is the greatest television series of all time but deserved a much better ending than the writers provided us with.  I strongly believe that Barney and Robin were meant to be together. The entire last season revolves around their wedding as we see them travel to their venue in the last episode of season eight. They both spent parts of the season freaking out over the wedding, but in the end realized that their love for each other was a much stronger emotion than their fears of settling.  The two characters also share various amounts of similarities that demonstrate a strong compatibility. They both have a Canadian background, commitment issues, play big pranks, are independent and grew a lot throughout the series. They always had each other’s backs and had so much chemistry during the show.  On the opposite side, Ted and Robin had a very forced relationship that made it awkward to watch. Other than the fact that he said, “I think I’m in love with you” on the first date, the two worked better as friends. Their friendship was evident in their inside joke based on saluting to words like “major” and “private.”  They consulted each other on relationships, lived together when they were purely platonic and Ted was Robin’s honorary Best Man. Ted overstepped many times by kissing Robin moments after she broke up with her ex boyfriend and trying to teach Barney how to be in a relationship with Robin. Most importantly, Ted and Robin didn’t have the same feelings about kids as he wanted two kids and she didn’t want any. This is a clear sign that they weren’t meant for each other.  Barney’s ending was one of the worst parts of the finale as he goes straight back to his old life after getting a divorce from Robin. He made a lot of progress throughout the show so it was disappointing to see that the writers threw away the character development. Barney ends up having a baby with a random stranger and this supposedly changes his life.  I would have liked to see him have more development as a father to show that he has truly changed, but we only get the one scene with the baby in the hospital. How are we to know that he didn’t ditch the family at some point? In season four Barney had already been intimate with 200 women meaning that by the end of the show it would have been close to 400. To only have one child after nine years seems completely random and forced.  Some people strongly believe that Ted and Robin were clearly meant to end up together as they always had a bond. Ted cheered her up when she was alone on Christmas and would do practically anything to make Robin happy. The fact is that Robin never demonstrated this kind of love for Ted as she struggled to tell him that she loved him. I admit that the couple was good in season one and two, but beyond that they were completely different and wanted opposite things in life.  “How I Met Your Mother” will still always be my favorite show despite the disappointing ending. As a fanbase let’s accept our own ending where Barney and Robin end up together living happily ever after. The death of the mother is upsetting but could be considered a good element to the conclusion of the story that I can stand behind. With these small changes the finale could have been legen-wait for it-DARY.  Jocelynn Messersmith is a journalism and broadcasting double major.

opinion-immigrants-are-not-just-numbers.html,OPINION: Immigrants are not just numbers,2025-01-29T00:15:00-06:00,Dawson Iasillo,"Eleven million people came into this country for a better tomorrow. 11 million people took the leap of faith to go to an unknown country for themselves and their families. 11 million is the number of illegal immigrants that some Americans are worried about.  With President Donald Trump’s ongoing mass deportations, 11 million people now sit scared in a country that was supposed to bring them freedom and a new lust for life. After Trump’s inauguration, there have been over 2,500 arrests for his mass deportation plan.  Immigrants are more than just a number. Each immigrant has a family, a friend, a job, something they are looking forward to and a reason to be in America.  Roberto Oran is the middle child of an impoverished family in Mexico. After his mom became ill due to birth complications from Oran’s birth, they had to sell their house and land to be able to afford her medical expenses. He continued to go to a strict Catholic school while living with his grandmother and graduated from ninth grade.    No schooling was available after, leading him to pick up watercolor art. He realized there was not much of a future in Mexico with his aspiring art career and knew the great opportunities America offered.  His Mexican-American uncle who lived in the U.S. encouraged him to cross the border. Oran’s art started winning prizes and it inspired him to continue his education. He attended Chemeteka Community College and graduated with his associate's degree in 2016. Oran worked for an organization called Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste which amplifies marginalized workers in art. Oran is one of many who found his success in the hands of America.  Heriberto Bolonas was only 6 years old when he and his family fled Mexico. After a long and tedious journey to America, they landed in Oregon. Bolonas worked hard and tested out of the English as a Second Language (ESL) program in fourth grade.  However, Bolonas got into trouble throughout middle school and even wound up in a gang. After recognizing where his path was headed, he left the gang to better himself.  During his senior year, Bolonas worked for the Bring Them Home campaign which advocated for 250 asylum seekers to come across the border. He quickly worked his way up to a leadership position at the campaign. From there he organized one of the most successful walkouts, the Forest Grove Walkout, which led to several ethnic bills being approved in Oregon. Bolonas paid his way through college and is currently studying history and minoring in law with hopes of returning back to teach at his former high school.  Francisco Bautista found his wife Laura in the same village where he grew up in Mexico. It had always been their dream to move to the U.S. one day and grow their weaving business. They also knew women had more rights than they did in their village of Teotitlán del Valle.  Together they arrived in the U.S. On their first night together they reflected on the snowfall out their window, excited that they would experience something as simple as the four seasons unfolding. They went on to have their own weaving business in the United States, like they had always dreamed of, and have two children, both of which are successful artists now. Francisco describes their journey to America as “destiny.”  No matter how extravagant or simple these people’s testimonies are, they have stories just like me and you. To outcast immigrants and support politicians who are consciously horrifying these individuals is inhumane. The numbers often disguise these personal stories, but they’re not to be overlooked amid these new laws.  Many argue that these immigrants are criminals and bad people. At the end of the day, they are just people. There is no reason to invalidate humanity because a person does not look or think the way someone else does. Immigrants are just as human as anyone who filled out the right forms or was born on American soil.  Each of these people has friends, coworkers, family members, and dreams they aspire to accomplish themselves. America is supposed to be the place where anything is possible for anyone, and it is nothing short of insufferable watching it limit its capabilities to cater to those the government favors.

opinion-it-s-okay-to-cry.html,OPINION: It’s okay to cry,2025-02-18T00:00:00-06:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"After working a nine hour shift all I wanted to do was go home and eat my dinner. I had been dreaming of eating a rice bowl all day when suddenly I went to place an order and the restaurant was closed. Immediately I started bawling my eyes out. It seems silly to cry over something so small and embarrassing that I was crying over food. So, why do people cry and should we prevent this emotion?  There are several reasons why someone may cry. Gender and culture actually play a role in how often a person sheds a tear. Women cry an average of 5.3 times a month whereas men only cry an average of 1.3 times per month. This stark difference is due to testosterone levels that may inhibit crying while women have higher levels of the hormone prolactin that promotes crying. In countries with greater freedom of expression such as Chile or the U.S., men and women cry more.  But, is crying bad? As infants it is the most important communication tool to show they need help. As adults tears serve as a more therapeutic role.  Although crying is often seen as a negative emotion, being able to express it demonstrates strength and relieves stress. The soothing effects of crying help to reduce pain and overall better an individual.  Crying is a natural response to different emotions that can benefit our health. Keeping feelings inside can become difficult and negatively affect health.  Studies show that repressive coping can cause a less resilient immune system, higher chance of cardiovascular disease and increase mental health conditions such as stress, anxiety and depression. Emotional tears contain more stress hormones. These tears serve a therapeutic role known as a good cry. Emotional crying makes people feel better. It is a good part of the healing process.  Shedding tears can act as a self-soothing mechanism. Individuals are able to release pent up emotions which leads to a sense of relief and emotional balance. Researchers have found that crying activates the parasympathetic nervous system. This helps the body rest and digest.  Crying may support the body and the mind by releasing the stress hormone cortisol and the mood-regulating hormone oxytocin. Sometimes we have to let our emotions flow to calm down and reevaluate our situation.  While crying has numerous emotional benefits, tears can also help to reduce pain. They dampen our fight or flight responses, helping us catch our breath and be able to relax. Since our emotions and pain get wrapped together the action of crying helps to alleviate the physical pain. Sometimes we focus so much on our tears that we forget the injury all together.  The level of control we have over our pain management is called gate control theory. This is the idea that our mental state can influence our perception of pain.  Still people believe that crying is a sign of weakness. From a young age many men are taught that they shouldn’t cry or talk about their emotions. This idea is a major obstacle for future relationships and self-esteem. Everyone should be able to express their emotions even when it means tearing up because it is natural. There should be no shame in walking out of a room with puffy red eyes. It shows that someone is strong and cares deeply.  At the end of the day no one wants to cry, but we have to get over the idea that crying is for weak people. Showing an emotion like crying helps us love harder. Sometimes to feel better we have to let out a few tears and remember that it’s okay to cry.",2025-02-18T06:00:00Z,2025,2,2025-02,OPINION,OPINION
opinion-learning-to-fail-in-college-is-an-important-lesson.html,OPINION: Learning to fail in college is an important lesson,2024-10-17T00:00:00-05:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"Many college students know the feeling of studying for an exam or project only to fall short. In that moment the failure can feel devastating. However, the life lessons from these setbacks can be some of the most profound lessons learned.  College is often seen as a time to learn and become successful, yet many students experience obstacles along the way.  From failing a class to not getting an internship, or even struggling with personal issues, failure can feel very overwhelming. Nevertheless, these experiences can help teach resilience, self-reflection and empathy which are essential life lessons that lead to long-term success.  Resilience is one of the most valuable life skills, as it empowers students to push forward even in the face of adversity.  Resilience is a skill developed through often uncomfortable hardship. Students must learn to persist and adapt, even when things don't go as planned.  This resilience is essential for students' future careers and personal lives helping them to adapt and overcome rather than giving up. Students who build resilience in college are better prepared to handle future challenges and are also more likely to have greater mental well-being.  Failure can also promote self-reflection which encourages students to reassess their approaches to different problems.  Self-reflection can allow students to look at what went wrong and how they could have done things differently. Through this self-reflection, students can better understand their strengths and weaknesses, which can help them gain valuable insights into what abilities they possess and which ones they still need to grow. This self-assessment can be a powerful tool that encourages lifelong learning and growth, which can help students make better-informed decisions in the future.  Additionally, failure can also create a sense of empathy and humility, two qualities that are very important in both personal and professional relationships.  By experiencing failure firsthand, students are able to develop a greater sense of compassion for others' struggles. This can help them build stronger connections and collaborate more effectively in teams.  This humility can also help students be open to feedback without being held back from improvement by their pride. Humility and empathy help lay the groundwork for strong personal relationships and effective leadership.  Some may argue that failure can discourage students, especially in environments where grades and success are often equated with their self-worth. For some students, challenges can impact their mental health and their future performance. While it's true that failure can frequently feel overwhelming, colleges should emphasize the importance of resilience and provide mental health resources for struggling students. Through these resources, students can grow positively from these experiences.  While failing is never ideal, college provides a valuable environment to learn from these setbacks. Learning to fail teaches qualities that are essential for future growth such as resilience and humility. In a world that demands perfection it can be difficult for students to take a step back and realize that these failures are not the end of the world, but rather steps towards a more successful future.

opinion-level-up-with-video-games.html,OPINION: Level up with video games,2025-02-04T00:00:00-06:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"Growing up my siblings and I would crowd around the gaming consoles in our living room. We logged in according to birth order, meaning I was always the last player as the youngest. From New Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Wii to Minecraft on the PlayStation 3, we have continually obsessed over video games. Even at night we would lay in our rooms playing on the Nintendo DS sneaking it under our pillows whenever our parents walked in.  Today, video games are a billion dollar industry with nearly two-thirds of American households playing games regularly. They originally got their start in research labs, but are now often at the forefront of computer technology.  Video games have many benefits as they strengthen friendships through shared experiences that create lasting memories and increase hand-eye coordination which improves cognitive skills. The supportive communities that are built from video games create a sense of security for many gamers.  Many people start playing certain video games due to their friends. Games are influential on relationships as 77% of boys play online video games with friends at least once a month. Shared experiences can be beneficial at helping people connect and work together to complete goals, similarly to how a sports team works.  About nine-tenths of teen video game players say they play with other people and 47% boast about friendships they have made specifically from playing video games. While it may seem silly, games help people learn to work with others and offer a chance to socialize without having to be in person.  Although I don’t live with my brother anymore, we always find time to play Fortnite together which keeps us close. It feels like I see him everyday because I am constantly interacting with him and staying updated on his life. Video games are a fun way to relax and  talk to those around you, strengthening friendships along the way.  Another positive aspect of video games is an increase in hand-eye coordination and other skills. Games require precise movements and fast reflexes helping the development of accurate hand-eye coordination.  Video games also help gamers with organization skills, whether it’s arranging chests, strategizing, memorization or all of the above. Defeating a boss or remembering a pattern takes a lot of practice.  A research study concluded that children who reported playing video games for three or more hours per day were faster and more accurate on both cognitive tasks than those who never played. These children who played games also had higher brain activity in regions of the brain associated with attention and memory than others.  Gaming communities also help build social connections around fans of a certain game, but more than that, these communities foster a safe place for players to connect and promote positive mental health.  The Stack Up Overwatch Program has specifically studied the benefits of the online gaming community in addressing the mental health crisis. Fans sometimes feel such a connection to other players of a game that they feel safe and vulnerable with those around them.  Communities can help fans feel safe, but in return fans help creators by actively engaging in their content. This helps developers get an understanding of what players want to see in a game which can decide updates and new features. An example of this would be the mob vote that Minecraft developers do each year at Minecon, an annual Minecraft convention where players and developers around the world gather. This live vote gives the creators an idea of what fans want to see added in their game.  There is a stigma that video games cause violence. People believe that violent games dealing with physical assault and other brutal aspects cause aggression in gamers, especially young teens. This is a common misconception because video games have proven to have no correlation with violent behaviors and aggression. Playing a fighting game will not make people more aggressive.  Video games are more than just a distraction for kids. They offer improvements to hand-eye coordination and give people an opportunity to build an online community. More than that, video games allow us to bond with our friends creating lasting memories over online experiences.  Jocelynn Messersmith is a freshman journalism and broadcasting double major.

opinion-mental-health-needs-to-be-taken-more-seriously.html,OPINION: Mental health needs to be taken more seriously,2024-10-25T00:00:00-05:00,Dawson Iasillo,"October is widely recognized as mental health awareness month and serves to educate others about what mental health means.  Recent generations have started to recognize what it means to have mental health issues. However, there is still a lack of intensity when it comes to handling the mental health emergency. As of now, America is considered to be in a mental health crisis.  Mental health first became recognized in the 1990s. Before then, the words depression and anxiety seemed somewhat foreign. Now, many brush off the idea of mental health and are stubborn to the fact that mental health problems are on the rise.  1 in 5 adults in America suffer from mental health. Regardless of this outlandish number, the seriousness of mental health is thrown out. It seems to be an afterthought and overshadowed by everything else that life throws. This leaves millions of people suffering in what feels like a battle they are facing alone. Mental health is the culprit for many things in society, yet it is still taken with a grain of salt despite its weighing effects on overall well-being and quality of life.    Not only does mental health consume the entire livelihood of an individual, but it also affects physical health as well. When induced anxiety, stress or depression occur, physical conditions come into play. Negative mental health has been proven to be a contributor to serious conditions such as diabetes, a higher risk of strokes and heart disease.  Physical health is recognized as an urgent issue while mental health is overlooked. People fail to realize that physical and mental health go hand-in-hand. Without mental health being treated properly, it turns into a substantial physical health issue.  People who struggle with mental health often take to unhealthy coping mechanisms. Those who suffer from depression and anxiety may turn to substance abuse, which can cause lifelong health deterioration. Mental health must be well-maintained and taken seriously in order to ensure total health of the body.  Mental health is a big enough struggle in itself. Finding the right mental health outlet is an even harder mountain to climb. Many therapists are insanely expensive, and very few insurance companies see mental health as a medical issue.  Being accepted to be a therapist’s client is another uphill battle. In America, there is a significant shortage of therapists. In turn, therapists have a lack of funding causing this absence of help.  Medication for mental health problems also can be extremely difficult to obtain. Due to how long mental health problems take to diagnose, they often go untreated.  Mental health has an overall lack of acknowledgement. Many are not aware of the physical effects it can have on an individual. The understanding of mental health diagnosis and how it affects everything about the individual is difficult to comprehend if not aware of it.  The negative stigma around mental health has been around for decades, and it hasn’t died down. People often jump to conclusions and place stereotypes on those who struggle with mental health issues.  People are referred to as “crazy” simply because of the internal battles in their heads. Therefore, many push down those feelings and downplay their issues. Many choose not to look further into their mental health hardships because of judgment from others. The general public does not have a complete understanding of the commonality  of mental health.  With the recent talk of mental health issues, people often miscategorize normal emotions as mental health problems. There is a clear difference between sadness and debilitating depression but, with the new awareness of mental health in society, some describe depression as a feeling rather than an illness.  However, if emotions are not handled properly, it is easy for them to snowball into a mental health issue. Without mental health being taken seriously, those normal emotions that everyone feels turns into something it never had to.  The lack of mental health support continues to be a critical issue. Mental health issues seep into the cracks of all parts of society. Without it being taken seriously, and with mental health problems on the rise, the cracks will begin to widen if action isn’t taken.

opinion-music-is-the-key-to-our-lives.html,OPINION: Music is the Key to Our Lives,2025-04-01T00:00:00-05:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"Everyday students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln wake up and start their morning routine by brushing their teeth, picking out an outfit and making their way to class. Whether they are walking or driving there seems to be one similarity: everyone listens to music.  Headphones and AirPods have infected our morning routines giving us a more exciting journey to class each day. From current pop stars such as Sabrina Carpenter or Taylor Swift to rap artists like Kendrick Lamar, college students start their days in such a similar but different way.  From ancient Greece where it was believed that music could develop the mind and soul to the Renaissance and Baroque period where music became sophisticated, music has been around for centuries and interpreted many different ways.  Music is tied to historical events such as the civil rights movement with songs such as “We Shall Overcome.” Today, music is filled with innovation and diversity.  While music is now viewed more as a form of entertainment, there are many aspects of music that people tend to overlook. Music is a plague, but instead of spreading disease it spreads many benefits that improve overall health. Music is much more than a simple song as it also holds memories.  Songs often remind people of the past and spark familiar memories when a recognizable rhythm plays. Studies show that music has a unique capacity to evoke both strong emotions and vivid autobiographical memories. This is an experience called music-evoked autobiographical memory and it is a common experience.  “In My Life” reminds me of my grandmother’s funeral and “Ophelia” reminds me of learning to drive for the first time. We correlate songs to important parts of our lives. Even with smaller events in our lives, songs can remind us of the past. For example, “Shape of You” by Ed Sheeran reminds me of sitting in my parents’ car with my sister blasting the music back and forth. It’s a simple silly thing, but these songs hold memories and parts of our pasts.  While listening to music is great for studying and strengthening relationships, music education has a vast amount of benefits alone. Even from a young age children can start gaining the benefits that music education holds. The process of learning and playing an instrument increases brain power and functionality which results in a boosted IQ and improved concentration. This accelerates brain development in kids and helps with sensory development. In the long term, music keeps our minds sharp and reduces the chance of developing Alzheimer’s and dementia.  People who study music often perform better in school. On average they achieve better grades and are 24% more likely to graduate high school. Making music helps students learn many skills including confidence, independence, perseverance, leadership and personal responsibility which sets them up for lifetime success.  Music is good for the mind as it reduces stress and improves well-being. Music is a powerful outlet that can regulate our emotions. While upbeat songs can make us more alert and focused, slower tempos can relax our muscles, quieting our minds and relieving stress from the day.  After a long stressful day it can be peaceful to lie down and put on a slow song to relax. Studies also show that listening to music can reduce cortisollevels, our hormone tied to stress.  Other than stress, music benefits our mental health. It evokes emotion as it connects to us which can improve our mood. After a long day it can be easy to let the emotions of hard work wash over us, but if we instead put on some music it can actually soothe our minds.  Parents sometimes worry that there is a harmful side to music. It is proven to evoke our emotions, but what happens when a person is feeling upset and listens to music that evokes their thoughts? When a person dwells on these feelings it can contribute to depression and anxiety which can be especially harmful to teens. It is important to understand the effects of music to make sure that we avoid these negative effects.  Music is much more than a simple song or melody. It allows the listener to follow a story and create lasting memories while also offering mental health benefits that improve well-being. Music cultivates bonds and offers educational benefits demonstrating its importance in our lives. As William Shakespeare once said, “If music be the food of love, play on.”  Jocelynn Messersmith is a freshman journalism and broadcasting double major.

opinion-my-top-five-sport-cities-in-america.html,OPINION: My top five sport cities in America,2025-09-22T00:00:00-05:00,Michael Tatten,"Debates often happen in all aspects of life, but sports debates can be among the most heated. One of the most controversial sports debates is between entire cities. The debate centers on which of these cities deserves the title of the best sports city in America.  Fans will argue that the history of the city and championships means the most. Others argue that pride and passion take the cake. Some say the city's atmosphere on gamedays proves to be the most important aspect. All of these factors have a say in determining which cities are the best.  Here are my top five sports cities in America, starting with number five:  5. Las Vegas:  Las Vegas is in my top five sports cities, which may come as a shock to many, because not long ago Las Vegas wasn't even on the sports map. Las Vegas was a hub for casinos, concerts and prize fights, rather than being a hub for professional sports. Las Vegas is still home to all of those things that earned the city its nickname “Sin City,” but now Las Vegas is a hub for professional sports. Las Vegas is the home of the Raiders, Aces, Golden Knights, the UFC, NBA Summer League, boxing’s biggest events and will soon be home of the A’s. Las Vegas residents have embraced these new teams and have shown top-tier pride and passion for the city.  4. Philadelphia:  There are a few cities in America that embody their sports teams like Philadelphia does. Philadelphia fans are known as some of the harshest fans in sports. Philadelphia fans will tell you it's just passion for their city, while others will tell you it's classless fan behavior. However, there is no denying Philadelphia fans' loyalty to the city. The Eagles have had a lot of success recently, as they were last year's Super Bowl champions. The Phillies, Flyers and 76ers all have deep-rooted history in their respective leagues. These Philadelphia sports teams are all woven into the identity of the city of Philadelphia.  3. New York City:  There isn't much argument for this city’s spot on this list. New York City has so much history when it comes to sports. It is a city that has two professional teams in nearly every major league. A lot of the teams that play in the New York City area are in the upper echelon of the most valuable sports teams as well. The New York City fans are also iconic for their passion for their teams, whether that's in a good light or not. The Yankees and Knicks are two of the most iconic, not only teams but brands in the world. The Mets, Jets, Nets, Giants, Rangers and Islanders give the people of New York City multiple other choices for teams to root for. New York City’s deep-rooted history is reflected in its sports culture, with legendary teams and iconic rivalries that have defined generations of sport.  2. Los Angeles:  No city has more star power than Los Angeles. The Lakers and Clippers are headlined by some of the biggest stars in the NBA, backed by ownership groups who are willing to spend to win. This isn't just the basketball teams. The Dodgers may be the biggest example of spending to win. Their star-studded lineup keeps the Dodgers in constant contention. The Rams and Chargers both returned to LA within the last decade and are both competitive teams for the Super Bowl. A lot of the Los Angeles teams right now are contenders for their league's respective championship. There is a deep history of sports in LA, with many of its teams being multiple-time championship winners. LA is also the home to many of the biggest sporting events that occur and that will continue as LA is set to host the 2028 Olympics. Los Angeles is one of the best sports cities in America, but it doesn't lie atop the list.  1. Boston:  In the number one spot on this list, I have Boston. Boston is home to the Celtics, Red Sox, Bruins and New England Patriots. The Celtics are the most successful basketball team in the history of the NBA. They have the richest history in the league as well. The Red Sox are one of the most noticeable brands in the world. There is a history that runs deep with this city and its franchises. The Patriots have been the most winning team in football in the 21st century and have solidified their place as one of the best franchises in all of sports. The fans of Boston show a lot of passion and pride for their teams. The expectation for Boston sports teams is to be a consistent contender. The history and constant winning are why Boston is atop this list.  sports@dailynebraskan.com",2025-09-22T05:00:00Z,2025,9,2025-09,OPINION,OPINION
opinion-nature-deserves-rights.html,OPINION: Nature deserves rights,2024-04-26T00:00:00-05:00,Elise St Clair,"Nature is often viewed as property for humans to treat however we see fit. It’s time to change this narrative.  The idea that nature deserves basic rights to not only exist, but thrive, is known as the Rights of Nature. The movement is grounded in the perspective that humans share the Earth with nature, and it has just as much of a right to flourish as we do. Considering everything humans gain from nature, the environment deserves our advocacy and legal protection in return.  While extending rights to natural entities appears absurd, this is a common practice. Corporations have been granted many of the same rights that individuals have for centuries. The Congressional Research Service reported in 2013 that corporations are protected by certain provisions of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth amendments, even though corporations are not people, nor are they mentioned in the U.S. Constitution.  Under these amendments, corporations have the right to free speech, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, due process, protection against double jeopardy, the rights to counsel, jury trial, speedy trial, to confront accusers, to subpoena witnesses and protection against excessive fines.  If corporations can be considered people in legal circumstances, nature should too. Just as a human representative for a corporation can stand in a courtroom as a spokesperson of a company, natural entities like rivers and forests should be afforded the right to a legal guardian to defend their rights.  Some places around the world have successfully granted nature such rights already. In 2006, a borough of 7,000 people in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania granted personhood to an ecosystem through the Tamaqua Borough Sewage Sludge Ordinance.  This ordinance allows a person to act as a legal guardian of a damaged ecosystem for legal purposes and use any money they receive through the judicial process to restore the ecosystem in question. These rights are only extended on a case-by-case basis when they should be established federally.  Similarly, in 2013, New Zealand gave the Te Urewera National Park legal personhood. The New Zealand government relinquished its control over the park and established a board of people to act as guardians over the park. This board is responsible for protecting the interests of Te Urewera as an entity with intrinsic value, and all decisions made regarding the land must be in the best interest of the land’s ecological systems and inhabitants.  Despite its relevance to the planet and human livelihood, nature cannot defend itself. Still, our laws affect the environment and its ability to thrive. Humans share the Earth with all of the planet’s inhabitants, and it’s time we stop pretending that we are the only species that matters.  As the primary contributor to climate change, and the only species on Earth with the power and influence to reverse its effects, it is our responsibility to advocate on nature’s behalf. It is time we give nature the respect it deserves in return for its beauty and resources that we selfishly take for granted.  Because nature is not human, some might argue that we have no place personifying nature. But giving nature rights does not mean personifying nature, it simply means considering natural arguments in judicial proceedings alongside human arguments.  Extending stewardship to the environment means giving a voice to the pollinators, rivers, plants and animals that live alongside us, especially when that means representing nature’s interests in a court of law.  Typically, environmental legislation passes when an environmental issue hurts people. The Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, some of the most well-known and influential federal environmental laws, are prime examples of this trend, but human involvement should not be a factor. We should be able to pass environmental legislation for the sole benefit of nature and its right to flourish.  Nature deserves that right.

opinion-nebraska-faces-brain-drain-because-it-lacks-opportunity.html,OPINION: Nebraska faces “brain drain’ because it lacks opportunity,2024-10-31T00:00:00-05:00,Bret Fulton,"Nebraska had a chronic loss of talent over the previous decade. The coined term “brain drain” was born out of students fleeing the state due to the lack of support from universities and post-graduate opportunities. As state leaders continue to scratch their heads and wonder why this mass exodus is happening, many Nebraska students already know they need to go out of state to further their educational and career goals.  While UNL’s enrollment increased this academic year for the first time since 2017, the other two universities in the NU system, University of Nebraska Omaha and University of Nebraska at Kearney, saw an enrollment drop. Therefore, the recent trend at UNL is not reflective of the entire state. Statewide, the rate of fleeing residents holding a bachelor’s degree or more has increased significantly since 2017 and continues to this day.  UNL increased investment in campus resources and is likely the cause of the upward trend in enrollment, retention and degree completion. Investments in universities for the purpose of improving those three metrics cannot center on scholarships and grants alone. Instead, other Nebraska universities should replicate UNL’s investment in student support programs such as the Center for Academic Success and Transition (CAST), financial well-being ambassadors and the Military and Veteran Success Center just to name a few.  When students feel supported academically, financially and emotionally, they are more likely to continue their degree paths and stay at UNL for all four years. It is not by pure coincidence that increasing student support also increases the three major metrics to measure a university’s success.  State leaders should take UNL’s model and build on the already existing statewide one. Nebraska has various scholarship programs including the Nebraska Opportunity Grant which offers scholarship grants based on financial need.  Simply offering scholarship money can only go so far, though. Throwing money to scholarships at universities can be useful to get students’ feet in the door. However, if Nebraska continues to refuse to invest in student support programs, like career development and mental health resources, they can expect to see retention and completion rates continue to fall at some in-state universities.  If the state takes those steps, graduates of Nebraska high schools will be more likely to choose a Nebraska University. However, this still does not ensure students won’t leave the state upon degree completion. Many previous graduates of UNL explain that there is simply a lack of opportunity in the state.  Nebraska needs to concentrate on attracting new industry from around the country. That new opportunity cannot be concentrated in just Lincoln and Omaha. Distributing opportunity across the central and western portions of the state is important as well, which was the subject of the Rural Projects Act. This act matched funds to non-profit economic development organizations. The opportunities should not include just jobs and opportunities, but housing to hold those new workers too.    The Nebraska Legislature addressed this housing concern in 2023 and resulted in the allocation of  $40 million toward a rural housing construction initiative. However, in May of that same year, Gov. Jim Pillen line item vetoed the fund allocation. After his veto, he continued to question why people continue to leave the state.  Sending money to scholarship programs will not be the end all be all solution to prevent college educated adults from leaving. Many students may simply want to leave the state they grew up in. However, UNL’s investments prove that increasing opportunity and support can at least retain students for the time they are attending the university. Clearly, the state should build on UNL’s model of success for other state universities as well as post-graduate opportunities.  If state leaders want to keep students in Nebraska, they need to give them a reason to. Instead, students have faced a state that constantly turns its back on their needs.

opinion-not-all-influencers-are-ethical.html,OPINION: Not all influencers are ethical,2025-04-03T00:00:00-05:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"Have you ever found yourself purchasing a product solely because your favorite influencer endorsed it? Sometimes this product may not live up to the hype, and consumers feel betrayed by the people they trust. Social media influencers shape consumer behavior through their perceived authenticity, and many times this influence can lead to the exploitation of their audiences.  The rise of social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok gave birth to a new form of marketing: influencer marketing. Influencers collaborate with brands to promote products and services, with their endorsements often feeling more personal and trustworthy. Because of this, consumers rely heavily on influencers’ recommendations.  Influencers’ authenticity and relatability make their endorsements highly persuasive, which directly impacts consumer purchasing decisions. They will often showcase their products in a casual everyday setting making their advertisements feel more like recommendations, instead of brands trying to sell an item.  A recent study found that 74% of people have purchased a product because an influencer recommended it. Consumers feel an emotional connection to influencers, which makes their endorsements feel personal.  The parasocial relationships created between the influencer and consumer can blur the line between genuine recommendations and paid advertisements. Consumers may believe that influencers are giving unbiased, unpaid reviews for products when they don't disclose that it is an advertisement. Because consumers are more likely to trust these influencers, companies can use this to their advantage and only have an influencer market for them. This lack of transparency in influencer marketing is unethical and could have major implications.  One of those being that influencers can more easily exploit their audiences by promoting products or services that may be ineffective or even harmful. By doing this they prioritize their personal gain over the well-being of their followers.  Some may promote unregulated supplements or financial schemes, all under the guise of helping their followers. Even ones who don't purposefully market bad products can still affect consumers.  Two studies show that children increased their intake of junk food when they were exposed to influencers marketing unhealthy food. Influencers have a direct impact on consumers of all ages on a daily basis, whether good or bad.  While there have been instances of exploitation, many influencers strive to maintain trust by promoting products they genuinely believe in and being transparent about sponsorships. They clearly label sponsored content and know that their platform is built on the relationship and trust they have with their audience. Still, it is always important for consumers to look at all influencers and advertisements, even ones they trust, with a skeptical eye.  As influencer marketing continues to grow, it is crucial for both influencers and consumers to be aware of the implications involved. Influencers should prioritize transparency and the well-being of their audiences, and consumers should approach endorsements with a critical eye. Influencer marketing isn't going away anytime soon, but realizing the influence it has on consumers' lives can help evolve it into a more trustworthy and beneficial part of our lives.

opinion-palestine-protests-expose-unl-s-free-speech-problem.html,OPINION: Palestine protests expose UNL’s free speech problem,2024-05-03T00:00:00-05:00,Bret Fulton,"The Justice for Palestine demonstration that took place at UNL’s Union Plaza on Wednesday, May 1, brought in students, faculty and community members. The Nebraska Union has been the site of countless demonstrations over the years, however, Wednesday’s events illustrate UNL’s restrictive free speech and protest policies.  Across the country, regulations by government entities are allowed to implement content neutral regulations concerning the time, manner and place of demonstrations. Considering the university environment, UNL is allowed to take these regulations further to respect the university's educational mission.  As a result, designated protest zones were enacted and maps are available to the public. The designated zone on the city campus does not extend past the fountain and, as a result, the space is restricting to protestors and should be reformed.  Possible reforms to the map could include expanding the designated protest zone past the fountain and into the Meier Commons. This would include the entire grass field behind the union fountain.  The Meier Commons is a very commonly used space for students and RSOs due to its placement and classification as a limited public forum. Expansion of the designated public forum will be less restrictive on the size and placement of student demonstrations and will also increase campus safety. Demonstrations will be less congested and enough space would be available to separate opposing counter protests to further maintain safety.  Questions arise of the university’s commitment to allow public demonstrations when the policies regarding designated public forums are so restrictive. It seems like an intentional policy choice that the largest public forum at UNL is on the lesser populated East Campus.  A tiny strip of concrete on UNL’s most populous campus has a major impact on the size and place of demonstrations. Protests organized by UNL students may also be too large to allow for any meaningful public involvement outside of the university. Therefore, expanding the zone will help UNL live up to its commitment on encouraging meaningful and safe public demonstrations.  The university has already made improvements on its free speech policies after being sanctioned by the American Association of University Professors. The sanction came after UNL fired a professor for making a lewd gesture to a student Turning Point USA recruiter. Administration responded by complying with guidelines to have adjunctive hearings prior to disciplinary action as well as implementing a controversial free speech policy.  While improvements to some may be deterioration to others, UNL has undoubtedly responded to faculty and student concerns in the past regarding speech. However, our campus cannot claim that free expression is good when a glaring restriction on free speech and student safety is still present.  The potential pushback from possibly expanding the dedicated public forum could be seen as infringing on students’ education and living standards in the nearby dorms.  However, academic buildings are far enough away so a demonstration will not seriously infringe on education and vital walkways will still be clear of obstruction. Furthermore, the East Campus zone extends right up to a dorm building with little to no objection.  Universities should adopt policies that best balance students’ and the community’s rights to speak with their purpose as a place of learning. Restricting demonstrations to a small concrete strip is a violation of students’ ability to freely express their views on campus.  Bret Fulton is a freshman political science major.

opinion-pay-attention-to-politics.html,OPINION: Pay Attention to Politics,2025-02-03T00:00:00-06:00,Dawson Iasillo,"There are many points in history where citizens followed politics blindly as they put their trust in the government. In some cases this trust wound up in genocide, a Communist country or even a pointless war.  In America, we are entitled to protest and oppose the government if we feel that things are not being run the way we want them to be. However, not paying attention to what is happening almost completely eliminates this right. Without awareness of what's going on, people cannot stand up for themselves and their country.  Paying attention to politics is crucial to be aware of decisions that affect our lives, our friends' lives and all other citizens’ lives. Staying informed empowers individuals to make educated decisions, hold leaders accountable and stand up for activism to make an equitable society.  Many forget that the horrific points in history did not just happen; there were steps taken to get to that point. The Holocaust did not just start with the execution of millions of people. It started with support from a susceptible audience. Plenty of people did not stay well informed, which ultimately led to fear mongering and control.  Adolf Hitler did not act alone. In fact, he was popular at his time. Hitler took advantage of those who chose not to get too involved in politics and catered his language and propaganda to them. We now have the knowledge to not let history repeat itself, yet many are adamant not to get into politics.  Watching from the sidelines is the same as being a bystander. Being educated in the world of current events allows individuals to trust their government to do the right things for citizens.  Some politicians should not be trusted and do not have their people’s best interests at heart. It is the democratic freedom to choose who is put into power, but with that holds the responsibility to make an educated decision.  With this, not taking the time to educate oneself ends up hurting others in the end. In the U.S. there is currently tons of oppression under President Donald Trump’s administration. Immigrants are scared, LGBTQ+ rights are on the lines and women’s access to their reproductive rights are being thrown around.  Somehow, plenty of people are still in the dark about what dangers this administration truly imposes. Politics has never been about how it affects just one person, but how it affects everyone around them. It should feel like a responsibility to become educated for the people who will continue to be left in the dark.  Many are not particularly aware of what is happening because the system may already be set up in their favor. Some are lucky and privileged enough to be able to say that the political systems in this country fit their narrative and rhetoric. Ignorance is a privilege.  In a weird way, not caring about politics almost shows a lack of empathy. Just because an individual may not be affected by policies doesn’t mean their neighbors, friends, loved ones or even total strangers won’t be.  Although something is not affecting someone yet does not mean they can’t speak out against it. If and when the political system ends up oppressing an individual who wasn’t well informed enough to speak out when it wasn’t for them, they shouldn’t be surprised when no one is there to speak out on their behalf.  Many are beginning to realize how important politics are. Plenty of Trump voters are now regretting their vote after Trump is executing what he promised to do all along. If these voters were well informed from the get-go, they would not be feeling this remorse and regret.  There is an argument to be had that it is hard in this day and age to be informed. While news media are biased and there are different narratives all over the place, a simple Google search and a fact-checking website can get any person the answer they’re looking for in a matter of minutes.  At this point, it is inexcusable to not be well aware of the things happening in our country. The power of social media and technology makes our world a whole lot smaller. There is not a lack of information, just a lack of people who search for that information.  Staying engaged in the political world acts as an advocate for everyone who is affected by politics; which is everyone. By remaining informed, we can influence policies that affect our daily lives and protect our rights. Ultimately, political awareness empowers us to be active participants in the democratic process. Change requires knowledge and there is power in knowledge.",2025-02-03T06:00:00Z,2025,2,2025-02,OPINION,OPINION
opinion-protect-the-legitimacy-of-courts.html,OPINION: Protect the legitimacy of courts,2025-03-03T09:25:00-06:00,Bret Fulton,"  Courts are among the most respected institutions in the American government. Today, however, the federal judiciary finds itself in a legitimacy crisis that may end up requiring major reforms. As the Trump administration and the public continue to question the authority of our judicial system, everyday Americans will pay the price.  On February 9, 2025, Vice President JD Vance made a post on X questioning the authority of courts when it comes to the executive branch’s “legitimate power.” What some consider a simple question, to others is considered an attack on the foundation that the judicial branch’s power rests on.  Even if the Trump administration were to ignore court decisions they don’t like, this won’t change the fact that those decisions are legally binding.  Decisions by federal courts remain legally binding regardless of whether or not the administration in power enforces it. Having an executive branch that ignores orders, as the Vice President suggested, is an attack on the founding principle of separation of powers. Furthermore, this sets up a dangerous precedent that future administrations of either party will continue to exercise and expand.  A history already exists of presidents ignoring court decisions. The infamous defiance of the Supreme Court by President Jackson where he stated that the Supreme Court should use its own military to enforce its decisions has been a bright stain on American history.  His refusal to enforce a Supreme Court decision respecting the Cheroke people’s right to sovereignty on their land eventually resulted in forced displacement and ethnic cleansing. Otherwise known as the trail of tears, this horrific period of American history has been labeled an attempted genocide by some scholars.  Our republican system requires that different powers are distributed among different actors, rather than being vested in a single executive. However, the excessive use of executive orders by both sides of the aisle, especially in the second Trump administration, undermines this core feature of American government. It is court decisions that make the final determination as to what law should be followed, not executive orders.    Officials in the executive branch and in congress should express their disagreement on the merits and legal groundings of court orders they don’t like, as checks and balances require it. However, that disagreement should exist within the confines of not attacking the foundational authority of the court itself and ensuring that appropriate enforcement actions are taken.  Recourse is built into the system if courts make decisions that the other two branches disagree with. In 2022, the Supreme Court limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate carbon as it was not considered a pollutant and congressional action was required.    Congress and the Biden administration passed a law classifying carbon as a pollutant and therefore restoring the EPA’s regulatory authority. This was a clear example of checks and balances in action. Of course, broader constitutional questions would require a constitutional amendment that is extremely difficult to accomplish.  Some may argue that the expansion of power within the executive branch and its ability to ignore court decisions is justified as it’s an elected branch of government. Furthermore, some may point to examples in history when courts made notoriously bad decisions that had long lasting, negative repercussions for generations.  However, if we allow a single person to make the final determination as to what the law is and execute it accordingly, we no longer have a republic, but a dictator. The simple fact that the president is elected doesn’t change this calculus. Courts have made terrible decisions in the past where enforcement has resulted in generational consequences. Proper recourse through other branches, or at least executing a narrow enforcement of the decision, serves more in the public’s interest than simply ignoring it.  If we want to continue living in a system where checks and balances are pushing against one another, we must empower courts and ensure that congress is actively exercising oversight on the other branches as well. If court orders continue to be ignored, the future of our republic looks grim.  Bret Fulton is a sophomore political science major.

opinion-sabrina-carpenter-isn-t-too-sexual-she-s-powerful.html,"OPINION: Sabrina Carpenter isn’t too sexual, she’s powerful",2025-09-19T00:00:00-05:00,Sydney Greenspan,"If society still mistakes a woman’s confidence for oversexualization, then Sabrina Carpenter’s newest album, “Man’s Best Friend,” might just be the wake-up call we all need. Her music isn’t about seduction or objectification, it’s about power.  Sabrina Carpenter’s rise in pop culture is nothing new. She went from a Disney Channel actress to a pop star with a distinctive sound and image that has only continued to gain popularity.  Her latest album, “Man’s Best Friend,” has quickly shot to number one on the Billboard 200 Chart. Yet, it is being criticized for being “too sexual.”  This backlash says far more about society’s discomfort with confident, sexual women than it does about Carpenter herself. Her music calls out the double standards that still dictate who is ‘allowed’ to be sexual in the public eye.  Far from being oversexualized, “Man’s Best Friend” celebrates female empowerment while exposing the hypocrisy women continue to face.  When male artists sing about sex, no one bats an eye. Harry Styles’ “Watermelon Sugar” is famously known for being about sex and when he was asked about the meaning of it, people did not seem concerned. The Weeknd’s “Earned It,” which was featured in Fifty Shades of Grey, was celebrated with radio time and even went diamond.  However, women face a different reality.  When women sing and perform about sex, they are shamed, discredited and criticized. Madonna in the 1980s, Britney Spears in the 2000s and Beyoncé in the 2010s have all faced backlash for the same themes men are praised for.  Carpenter joins this lineage of women being punished for confidence and sexual expression, proving that society still treats female sexuality as controversial while excusing men who do the same.  What critics are overlooking is that Carpenter’s music is not about objectification, it’s about expression. With irony and humor, her lyrics flip the script on how women are usually framed in pop music.  She isn’t performing for the male gaze; she’s creating for herself and for the women who see their own strength reflected in her confidence.  Songs like “Feather,” from the album ""emails i can’t send"", shows her claiming control of her story and redefining what empowerment looks like. Carpenter is playful, sexual and bold on her own terms. For fans, her confidence feels like permission to take up space.  She is not the problem, society is. By celebrating femininity that is playful, powerful, sexual and self-directed, Carpenter helps shift pop culture toward a more authentic version of womanhood that refuses to shrink for patriarchal comfort. She represents a broader wave of women in pop reshaping feminism through culture, proving that self-expression doesn’t have to conform to outdated norms.  Of course, not everyone agrees.  The cover of ""Man’s Best Friend"" stirred up criticism online, with some calling it raunchy, excessive or even misogynistic. Yet, this outrage misses the point. Carpenter exaggerates the very things critics complain about, using humor and irony to reveal how fragile these particular values still are.  In fact, the criticism only strengthens her message: society is more uncomfortable with women owning their sexuality than with men flaunting theirs. Carpenter’s confidence, playfulness and boldness turn criticism into proof of the very power she is claiming.  Her music isn’t about being oversexualized; it’s about celebrating power. By challenging double standards, empowering women and broadening cultural representation, Carpenter proves that confidence and sexuality are not weaknesses but strengths.  Her success shows a simple truth and a sad reality: society still struggles to see a woman’s confidence as strength. Owning your power and sexuality should never be controversial, and Carpenter proves exactly how empowering that can be.

opinion-social-media-promotes-hateful-behavior.html,OPINION: Social media promotes hateful behavior,2024-11-13T00:00:00-06:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"When scrolling through social media there are often hateful comments and bullying posts. This isn't an unusual experience but rather the new norm.  Social media was created to bring people together, build bridges and create a voice for everyone. However, now the algorithms prioritize engagement which can lead to social media showing controversial or negative content because it creates more reactions. This normalizes hateful behavior and creates an echo chamber effect where toxic behavior is shown more often.  Social media algorithms are designed to prioritize content that draws attention and engagement, even if it’s negative.  Controversial content tends to get more likes, comments and shares which means it will likely end up at the top of feeds or for you pages. This allows inflammatory content to be seen by many people, conditioning viewers to see it as acceptable.  Especially when many platforms have weak guidelines against this behavior they allow it to go unchecked. While many community guidelines try to prohibit harassment and abusive behavior these rules are often not enforced or hard to prove.  With the sheer volume of hateful behavior, it is hard for platforms to keep up with the amount of reports. Frequently it takes a post being reported many times before the offensive content is addressed. This lack of accountability shows that hateful behavior is tolerated and often overlooked. When people realize that there is no punishment for their behavior it becomes even more normalized.  This lack of accountability paired with the anonymity of social media allows people to say things they wouldn’t in real life.  In face-to-face interactions, people are less likely to engage in harmful or offensive behavior. Without this in-person interaction, they lose empathy. People feel encouraged to lash out, bully and attack others without considering their impact. Being online gives users a shield to say things they wouldn't in person. The faceless interactions remove accountability and create a breeding ground for toxic behavior and words.  Some argue that social media doesn’t normalize harmful behavior but rather exposes how society really is. They may believe that social media has given a voice to marginalized communities allowing them to share their stories. While it is true that social media has helped many positive movements and can create positive change, it’s hard to deny that it can have the opposite effect. The algorithms reward engagement no matter whether it is good or bad.  Social media platforms must take accountability for the environment that they have created. To combat this hate, social media platforms need to reevaluate their algorithms and guidelines to encourage accountability for others. These steps would ensure hate is less visible on the platform and seen as less acceptable. Without these changes, the platforms designed to bring us together will continue to push us further apart.

opinion-spending-money-on-items-you-enjoy-isnt-a-waste.html,OPINION: Spending money on items you enjoy isn't a waste,2024-10-25T00:00:00-05:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"As college students, we have all been told at one time or another to not buy something because it's a waste of money that we should be saving. However, what if treating oneself to an item of clothing or splurging on a beloved hobby isn’t as wasteful as we have been told? Spending money on things students genuinely enjoy isn’t a waste, rather, it's an investment in their well-being and happiness.  Many college students are told to plan for the future and save the little money they have. With the cost of tuition, housing and any other large purchases for the future, we are constantly pressured to cut out any unnecessary spending. Having this mindset can overlook how valuable personal enjoyment and happiness can be to our lives. Sometimes spending money on what brings students joy can be just as important as saving for the future.  Spending money on enjoyable things can primarily help boost one’s mood and mental health.    College life can be stressful between classes, extracurriculars and jobs. Many of us are juggling a lot of responsibilities which can take a toll on our mental health. Spending money on something, whether it's a night out with friends or that new pair of shoes, can give students a much-needed mental break. While these purchases might not be seen as necessary, they help contribute to overall happiness and can improve one’s emotional well-being which is as important as anything else students spend their money on.  One of the best ways students can spend money is on experiences like concerts, trips or other events which help create memories that can last a lifetime.  These memories can bring about long-term satisfaction and happiness which makes them a valuable investment in students’ life experiences. When thinking back to some favorite memories they likely revolve around fun experiences, therefore spending money to create these moments is not wasteful, but enriching. They can help students connect with others and build relationships that can make their college years much more fulfilling.    Spending money on hobbies or passions, like art supplies, workout equipment or classes, can help students discover new talents and deepen their sense of self, all contributing positively to the future.  These aren't just frivolous expenses but, rather, investments in students’ future selves. Spending money on things students are passionate about can help cultivate their interests in ways that can open up new opportunities in the future. Purchasing things students enjoy can help them become more well-rounded and engaged in their own lives.  Some may argue that unnecessary spending could lead to financial stress later on and that it's better to focus on saving as much as possible now. While it is important to save some, it’s also necessary to find a balance between financial responsibility and spending money on enjoyment. Practicing mindful spending can be done without putting a strain on long-term savings. Moderation is key to ensuring that the money students spend aligns with both their values and happiness.  Spending money on enjoyable things isn’t a waste, it’s an investment in students’ happiness and well-being. While it’s important to be financially responsible, there’s also value in treating oneself with things that make life more pleasurable. Life is about more than just saving every penny, it’s also about creating joy with enriching items and experiences along the way. College is a time to create memories, discover passions and develop into the person students want to be. Sometimes that means spending a bit of money on things that make one genuinely happy.

opinion-spotify-is-scamming-people.html,OPINION: Spotify is scamming people,2024-10-25T00:00:00-05:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"Whether I am walking to class or driving to work, I am always powered by music ringing in my ears. Spotify has always been my go-to when listening to my favorite artists or when I need simple study music to lock in for my next exam. Although I am an avid fan of the app I have found myself skipping over more and more songs with every listen.  Spotify, the king of all audio streaming services, allows its users to listen to millions of songs and podcasts from content creators all over the world. The ease of use, customization options and the fact that the app is free makes it an obvious fan favorite among college students and working professionals. Yet recently the streaming service faced backlash from the community over the app’s shuffle feature not truly being randomized.  Spotify is scamming its users by falsely advertising the shuffle feature as random, when in reality, it uses algorithms that manipulate playlists and often repeat the same songs.  Everyone listens to music in different ways on the app. Personally, I like to add hundreds of songs to my liked playlist and shuffle my list, but I’ve noticed that I get certain songs over and over while some play once in a blue moon.  At first I thought I was going crazy until I realized that this has been a problem within the community. As it turns out, Spotify weighs the scale to determine which songs to play so that the music blends together. As a result, Spotify acts as a digital DJ making us subject to jarring transitions.  While the thought is considerate, most people want a total random shuffle feature that isn’t weighed. I also believe that this scale isn’t effective as I have gone from Glimpse of Us by Joji to the Texas Song from Spongebob. These two songs have a totally different vibe yet Spotify paired them next to each other, so I question the accuracy of the Spotify shuffle button.  When users select the shuffle feature, they don’t want a curated playlist that automatically mixes the same ten songs. The issue with shuffle on a liked songs playlist is even more annoying since Spotify introduced their artificial intelligence DJ. The AI DJ is supposed to curate a playlist from liked songs and give commentary and new suggestions similar to them. With this, there is no point for the company to control playlist shuffles.  I’ve noticed this biased feature on more than my liked songs playlist. Whenever I go directly to an artist to listen to their music, I find that hitting shuffle just plays songs that I have previously listened to and added to my liked playlist. Oftentimes when I search by an artist I want to hear more of their niche songs that I haven’t discovered. However, every time I click on a specific artist I get the same songs that are already added to my playlist, meaning I have to skip over multiple hits in order to hear different music.  The Spotify community realized that this may be due to the fact that shuffle is based on the popularity of a song. This means that when I click on a famous artist such as Kendrick Lamar, I will keep getting his most popular songs or features instead of his earlier work that isn’t in the limelight as much. The community is becoming very frustrated with overplayed songs saying that they won’t go back to the app until the issue is resolved.  Since Spotify is their own company, they can do whatever they want with their app but I do find it interesting that the company hides their use of algorithms as they advertise their shuffle as “tracks play randomly”.  A main problem with this shuffle format is that users have to pay for premium in order to skip songs that are constantly repeated. Without Spotify premium users only have six skips per hour which can easily add up when most songs are from artists the user doesn’t even listen to. It feels as though Spotify purposefully triggers the community in order to get them to spend extra money on their app.  While this can be considered a good business practice, it also faces community backlash. The Spotify community is in an uproar saying the company doesn’t care about its users and that it is  just as bad as other music streaming services such as Apple Music or Pandora.  However, there is a point that Spotify doesn’t force people to pay for certain benefits in their app. Although this may be true, the company is still falsely advertising its services, especially for those who don’t pay.  Before I bought premium I remember each advertisement claimed there would be 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening when it was really two songs later that I got another advertisement. It got so bad that I would get an advertisement in the middle of my songs. Therefore, even if Spotify can’t actually force users to buy premium, they can certainly push their agenda to drive people crazy until they pay to make it end.  Spotify may still be the largest audio streaming service, but it’s important to recognize the false advertisement of the shuffle feature being random when they are clearly using algorithms that manipulate playlists. The company should listen to their fanbase and acknowledge their use of an algorithm rather than frustrate and potentially lose the users who want a truly randomized listening experience.

opinion-the-electoral-college-should-be-abolished.html,OPINION: The Electoral College should be abolished,2024-10-16T00:00:00-05:00,Dawson Iasillo,"In a country founded on the words, “We the people,” the Electoral College is anything but for the people.  The Electoral College was founded around the same time as the Constitution. While the country was working out its kinks, the Electoral College was the easiest way to make sure elections were properly done. The Electoral College has the power to certify elections. To ensure the early Americans were not voting for the wrong person right out the gate, the Electoral College was a compromise of powers between the government and the American people.  The Electoral College is divided between the states in an “all-or-nothing” type format. The number of electoral votes is dependent on the state’s population. The number of House of Representatives and Senators for each state is the total number of votes for that individual state. For instance, Texas has two senators and 38 representatives in the Texas House, so the state gets 40 votes in the U.S. Presidential Election.  In simpler terms, if the majority of the state population votes a certain way, all electoral votes go toward that candidate.  The Electoral College undermines the democratic principles that America stands on and invalidates the voice of the people.  Smaller states get much more of a say in elections than larger states because the Electoral College is not a direct population vote. Wyoming is the perfect example of this. Wyoming’s population is around 500,000 people. However, they are getting much more of a vote per person compared to a state like Texas or California. Smaller states get more representation because of each state’s guaranteed two senators.  This advocates for more conservative candidates, making it somewhat of an unjust system. The majority of these less populated, rural states, tend to vote for the Republican candidate. This leaves an uphill battle for the other candidates.  While the Electoral College is a representation of the population, it is not the popular vote. There have been very few cases where the Electoral College goes directly against the popular vote, but cases exist nonetheless, the most recent being the 2016 election. Donald Trump won the presidential ticket with 304 electoral votes. Hillary Clinton, however, took most of the country’s votes. With more than 3 million votes, Clinton was still defeated.  America is extremely reliant on serving its people and listening to them. That was the sole purpose of forming a new country from the beginning. It is nothing but hypocritical for a country that is derived from freedom to the people to go directly against what the majority voted for.  At the time the Electoral College was made, there clearly was not the technology to count votes in a timely manner. Therefore, the Electoral College made it quicker and easier to certify elections and allowed room for miscounting errors.  When America was first established, the Founding Fathers were fearful of putting the general public in complete charge. The Electoral College allowed them the ability to be able to veto the vote if they felt it was the wrong one. The Electoral College makes complete sense during the time it was formed.  However, given the modern-day technology we currently possess, it seems foolish not to take advantage and switch to using the popular vote as the primary way to elect our president. The Electoral College is nothing but outdated. A system that was formed over 200 years ago, written during a dark time in our country’s history, should be changed and modified.  There is an argument to be made that the Electoral College promotes politicians to reach the rural areas that often don’t get recognition. The battleground states and areas are often the states, counties and cities that get overlooked. Politicians are aware that battleground areas are the most powerful and influential parts of an election, therefore they spend the majority of their campaigns making appearances in these states.  With this being said, there are plenty of ways around reaching those battleground states without having the Electoral College in play. With social media, Zoom conferences and the efficiency of traveling, candidates would still easily be able to reach all of the rural areas that they need to.  It only makes sense to give fair representation to each individual and give the American citizens the opportunity for their voice to be heard. The U.S. needs to amplify what their morals are based upon and abolish the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated system that does not advocate and benefit the people of America. It is long overdue to fix this system and to simply convert to the popular vote.  Dawson Iasillo is a sophomore political science and journalism major.

opinion-the-elephant-in-the-room-tariffs.html,OPINION: The elephant in the room: Tariffs,2025-02-17T11:21:00-06:00,Dawson Iasillo,"A major policy President Donald Trump preached about during his campaign trail was his effort to bring down the cost of living. He seemed outraged and astonished by the inflation and blamed the costs on Joe Biden’s presidency. Yet, Trump’s tariffs on the biggest trading countries like Canada, Mexico and China have done the exact opposite of his campaign promises.  Tariffs are the tax on imported goods from foreign countries. Contrary to popular belief that tariffs are paid by other countries, the consumers of the country that implemented the tariffs are those who pay them.  In this case, the average American citizen will be the one paying the higher prices. Trump first implemented these tariffs on Feb.12, 2025. He has since implemented further tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports that will begin March 12.  Trump’s tariffs will harm the U.S. economy and increase costs for consumers and businesses. In turn, this will disrupt global supply chains and hurt American exports. Tariffs pose a huge risk of landing the U.S. in a retaliatory tariff war.  There are without a doubt troubles when it comes to paying for groceries and products in the U.S. However, there are common misconceptions that placing tariffs on foreign countries will somehow lower the prices for consumers. In order for foreign countries to be able to afford these tariffs, the costs for consumers increase substantially.  Americans can expect to see more than a $185 increase in their annual grocery bills, over a $550 increase in big-box store purchases and significant increases in other items such as phones and computers.  Not only will tariffs affect the consumer's cost of living, but they will also affect American imports as a whole. In the event that Canada and Mexico retaliate as they proposed they would, Americans could see over 400,000 job losses.  Tariffs can be a great tool when necessary, but when the U.S. throws around tariffs like it’s nothing, trading partners will begin to recognize the unpredictability and move their trade agreements to other countries. American imports will become less valuable when few countries will trade with the U.S.  The U.S. is a major trading partner worldwide. Placing tariffs on other countries and retaliatory tariffs will lead to a global domino effect. With the amount of countries that trade with the U.S., consumers internationally will have to hike up their prices to keep up with the tariffs. This leaves the supply chain incredibly disrupted and inflation to increase at an infeasible level.  Trump claims that America can stand on its own and has all the resources domestically. Not only does the U.S. not have all of the resources domestically for what Americans need, but trade is a key component to maintaining allies internationally. Countries do not want to go to war with countries they trade with no matter how much they oppose them.  War is astronomically expensive. No country is going to want to war with a country they trade with simply because it makes it harder to get their imports. Furthermore, countries who trade with a country that is at war will help them financially so their trade deals can get back on track. Trade creates an economic motivation to maintain allies and tariffs make that relationship extremely rocky.  Tariffs may seem good on the surface but a deeper dive into tariffs shows the downsides. Trump’s proposal to bring down the cost of living for the average American citizen was nothing more than a political strategy and a way to take advantage of his voters. Tariffs will impose complete opposition to Trump’s goal of “Making America Great Again” and will only leave the American people more vulnerable than they already are.

opinion-the-financial-gender-inequalities.html,OPINION: The financial gender inequalities,2024-10-30T00:00:00-05:00,Dawson Iasillo,"Despite the recent steps forward in gender equality, the financial piece of the puzzle has yet to catch up with the times. Achieving gender equality is a long process and all boxes must be checked before we achieve gender equality. There are many aspects that have to catch up to the rest of the world when it comes to gender equality, and the financial breach is a huge part in being one step closer.  The gender pay gap is the difference in earnings between men and women. Historically, women were expected to fulfill household duties and not seen as workers. Instead, they were held to the standard to cook, clean and stay home with the children. Since women have entered the workforce, societal standards created on this gender inequality are not up to standard.  While the pay gap leaves women struggling more than men, pink tax is no help. Pink tax is a phenomenon formed in the 90s when products for females were priced higher than the same products for men.  Consumer and research advocacy originally discovered the strange increase between haircut prices. Researchers noticed that dry cuts for men were less costly than dry cuts for females. However, it was later when retail products’ pink tax was realized in stores.  The gender pay gap in the workforce is a huge issue in gender equality. Even if the work being done is on a completely even playing field, the misogyny of society seeps in regardless.  Women make approximately 82 cents of a dollar compared to men, creating a domino effect.  When women are aware they are not getting paid their worth, it discourages their talents and efforts that could be put forward for a brighter future. Women may be encouraged by society to go back to the outdated times of staying at home to do household duties.  In retail, there is a significant difference in prices for females and males. Women pay on average $1,300 more than men because of the pink tax in stores.  Prices of tampons and feminine products significantly increased in the past few years. Further than this, womens’ razors, body washes, shampoos and even pens cost more than the masculine version of those same products.  Insurance companies follow suit as they don't recognize some female health concerns. The odds are stacked against females to be able to get ahead in society financially.  Birth control is a reasonable medicine to help irregular periods, acne and pregnancy. Yet, most insurance companies do not view birth control as something that should be covered, though it can cost up to $2,400 annually.  While some may say that job differences and hours of work might play a role in the gender pay gap, it has been proven that the pay gap is still relevant. Women are clearly being put out by the financial state of the world and yet, barely anyone is taking action for this. There are plenty of opportunities for change across the board, but little measures have been taken.  Modern society needs to recognize that these financial systems are built on the foundation of gender disparities. They have to be reconstructed in a way that takes into account the financial discrimination against women and how much harder it is for them to get ahead financially.

opinion-the-husker-x-lululemon-collaboration-was-a-waste-of-time.html,OPINION: The Husker x Lululemon collaboration was a waste of time,2024-10-02T00:00:00-05:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"As a longtime Husker fan and an occasional Lululemon wearer, the Lululemon x Husker collaboration piqued my interest. Lululemon, one of the most popular brands among young people, partnered with one of the most passionate fan bases in the country. However, the reality of the grand opening left me feeling underwhelmed, unsure if it was worth the hype and like the drop was a complete waste of time.  One of the main issues with the Lululemon x Husker drop was its lack of creativity. For a collaboration that merged two iconic brands, the drop felt as though it was thrown together.  The collection was almost entirely standard Lululemon clothes with a hint of a Husker “N”. If fans are paying more than average for a piece of Lululemon, they expect designs that are new and innovative, something that truly represents Nebraska's spirit. Instead, they put out the same Lululemon gear you can buy in one of their stores with a subtle “N” on the corner.  While Lululemon is known as a pricier athletic brand with many willing to pay the price, a collaboration with a college team should have been more accessible for the average college student.  Some fans may have appreciated the sleek designs of the collab, but others found it hard to justify spending hundreds of dollars on clothes with just an “N” or “Husker” written on it. Husker fans want gear that shows off their school pride in a bold way, and with such a steep price tag and basic designs, Lululemon turned off many potential customers. Why spend $88 on a basic t-shirt when you can find more affordable, original Husker gear somewhere else?  On top of lacking creativity and having a high price tag, the drop was too exclusive with too little product.  Students in Greek Life were sent emails allowing them early access to shop the collaboration. Because of this, many styles and sizes were sold out for the public opening and left many fans disappointed. Lululemon should have known the collaboration would cause a buzz and ensured there would be enough product for both early entry and the grand opening shoppers.  Some may argue that this collaboration was a good thing because it puts Nebraska on the map and could create future collaborations. While it may put Nebraska on the map, that doesn’t mean that the first collaboration shouldn’t have been creative. Hopefully this collaboration opens the doorway for more creative brands to create pieces that Husker fans would actually be proud to wear.  Ultimately this collaboration was a missed opportunity from all sides. Lululemon had the chance to create unique and timeless Husker gear, but instead they created items that aren't memorable or worth the price. Instead of creating gear to celebrate the Huskers, it was an attempt to capitalize on fan and brand loyalty without offering anything of substance. If the goal of the collaboration was to merge Lululemon’s quality high-end clothing with Husker spirit, then this drop fell short. Nebraska's passionate fanbase deserves something that reflects their spirit, not a shirt with a small, generic logo.  Hannah Nazarenus is a junior journalism and ADPR major.

opinion-the-power-of-sports-betting.html,OPINION: The power of sports betting,2025-04-10T12:19:00-05:00,Michael Tatten,"It’s one of the world’s fastest-growing industries and it fits in your pocket. Sports betting is more accessible than ever, and it’s changing the way we watch, talk about and profit from sports.  Sports betting is rapidly transforming the gambling landscape, and it should be fully legalized across all states. Its growing popularity brings undeniable benefits–driving economic growth, increasing fan engagement, and creating a safer, more regulated environment for responsible gambling.  Now in its seventh year of regulated operations beyond Las Vegas, the U.S. sports betting industry has generated over $40 billion in total revenue from nearly $500 billion in wagers placed, showcasing just how powerful and profitable this market has become.  Surprisingly the gaming industry in the U.S. employs more people than the postal service or air travel, employing over 700,000 people. There are a wide range of jobs the industry provides, from technology and marketing, to hospitality and compliance. As sports betting continues to grow, it will create jobs across emerging technology fields like artificial intelligence, Blockchain and virtual reality, while also expanding opportunities in content creation, influencer marketing and entertainment.  Sports betting also brings in significant taxes. In just January 2025, taxes associated with sports betting were up to $350 million. New York has a massive 51% tax on sports betting, which has allowed the state to collect nearly $2 billion in just three years. If all states were to legalize sports betting, states would be able to collect a significant amount of taxes, which can help build up cities’ infrastructure and economy, while potentially lowering other taxes.  There has been a rise in engagement in sports and it is partially due to what sport betting brings to the actual games. Some people are just getting into sports because of sports betting, and in other cases, sports betting brought back the passion fans once had for these sports. 67% of NFL fans say they watch more games when gambling.    This has also led to an influx of new fans for sports. The options are endless on what fans can bet on. Anything ranging from football and basketball to UFC and boxing. Leagues, teams and organizations are all going to be more profitable due to sports betting. Sports betting brings new eyes to a lot of sports.  In 2006, President Geroge W. Bush signed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) into law. The UIGEA essentially prevented certain online gambling sites on the U.S. market. But, there were ways around this law, such as betting on sites that operated outside of the U.S.’s jurisdiction. They would gamble their money in sites offshore, like Panama and Costa Rica, where gambling was legal.  It made sense for the original U.S. states to legalize sports gambling then, and it makes sense for the rest of the states who have not to follow suit now. The states would be able to regulate the market as they choose, while also reaping the economic benefits that sports betting provides.  However, not all that comes with sports betting is good. Gambling addictions can be caused by sports betting which can lead to mental health, financial, social and other personal problems. With the popularity of sports betting continuing to grow, a rise in gambling addictions has occurred. Gambling appeals to the younger generations, potentially causing early gambling addictions.  In order to counteract gambling addictions, the sportsbooks have opened up and supported  gambling helplines that can counteract gambling addictions. This helpline is available in all 50 states. Sportsbooks also work to make sure that the gamblers are of age and have the funds to support their betting. Though gambling addictions are a serious problem in our country, many people are working to make sports betting safe.  Sports betting should be legalized in all states because it can open up a whole new market that can help boost state’s economies, provide the spark needed for fans to be excited about sports again and create a safe, regulated environment for legal gambling.

opinion-the-save-act-is-a-step-backward-for-voter-rights.html,OPINION: The SAVE Act is a step backward for voter rights,2025-04-17T00:00:00-05:00,Dawson Iasillo,"Republicans claim to be the party that supports women and marginalized groups and opposes Project 2025. Yet, their actions completely undermine that.  Marginalized communities were not kept in mind while drafting the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.  The SAVE Act is a proposal that would require registered voters to provide both a valid driver’s license and birth certificate. The kicker is, each of these documents would have to match to a tee. The act would also require all individuals to register or update their registration in person. This would go along with severely limiting mail-in or online applications.  With the bill being passed through the House of Representatives on April 10, it is realistic to start thinking about how women will be able to vote if this law is enforced.  The act would make it nearly impossible for married women to vote. Most married women change their last names meaning that their driver's license would not match their birth certificate. This would hurt over 69 million women’s ability to vote.  This seems like a clear issue that would have been brought up while drafting this bill. However, there is nothing in the bill regarding this concern. Republicans arguing that they are a party that supports women only to go on and draft a bill that silences women is more than a contradiction. It’s undemocratic.  Voting registration in the U.S. is already extremely low. It is absolutely foolish for a democratic republic to try to further limit the amount of people who can vote. The SAVE Act would ban online registration or registering by mail. This would clearly limit the abilities of the disabled, elderly and even college students who don’t live at home.  The individuals who have every right to vote and have their voices heard should not be punished because they cannot show up in person. This is simply another law to silence Americans. But, if Americans’ voices weren’t so powerful, they would not try to silence them.  For many generations, marginalized communities have fought incredibly hard to obtain their right to vote. People have catalyzed and put themselves on the line for their children and grandchildren. The simple proposal of this bill is a horrific piece of history to be left in this country.  Let’s be abundantly clear. Voter fraud is nothing more than a myth. There is so little if any, credible evidence. Non-citizens have been banned from voting since 1924. Anyone who is afraid of voter fraud has bought into the propaganda. The goal of this bill is to ensure laws that are already in place. If it wouldn’t be so detrimental, it would be laughable.  If this bill is passed through the Senate, where will the line be drawn? Will there be literacy tests? Will there be a poll tax? We can’t keep taking steps backward that are going to silence Americans for generations to come.  As history has shown, any erosion of voting rights often falls hardest on those already facing systemic barriers. Women and those from marginalized communities are no exception. Excluding eligible voters who lack access to specific documents, face name mismatches due to marriage or divorce or live in areas with limited access to voting locations are all those who would be punished for no fault of their own. To preserve a truly representative democracy, leaders must ensure that reforms aimed at securing elections do not come at the cost of silencing the voices of millions of people. Especially those who have fought long and hard for their rightful place at the ballot box.  Dawson Iasillo is a sophomore political science and journalism major.

opinion-third-party-protesting-backfired-in-2024.html,OPINION: Third-party protesting backfired in 2024,2025-03-26T00:00:00-05:00,Bret Fulton,"The spoiler effect, or when a third-party candidate splits the vote causing an unintended winner, has been a hallmark of American politics. In the 2024 presidential election, it’s possible we were witness to some of the ramifications of the Palestine third-party protest vote.  Protest voting’s use in the 2024 election season kicked off in the 2024 Michigan Democratic presidential primary. The “uncommitted” movement eventually won two delegates in the Democratic National Convention, signaling to the Biden Administration to change its policy on Israel.  Some activists extended this logic of protest voting into the general election in November. Activists such as Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant threw support behind Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein while making comments about Michigan being ground zero to defeat Harris.  Sawant was a vocal anti-Harris activist in her community after it became clear Harris would secure the Democratic nomination for president. While Sawant’s comments may have had minimal pull on voters in Michigan, the campaign as a whole did not, as many predominantly muslim communities across the state swung in favor of Trump.    America’s two-party duopoly has held a chokehold on American politics for decades, thus making it extremely difficult for third parties, such as the Green Party, to become real contenders for political power. Even while the Green Party holds less than 200 elected offices around the country, Stein has still run in the 2012, 2016 and 2024 presidential elections.  Many protest voters felt as though Stein stood in opposition to both Republican and Democrats’ policies on Gaza. However, her long-shot campaign's participation in the election set up a clear spoiler effect. As a result, it’s possible that Stein garnered enough votes to make Trump’s victory in states like Michigan much easier. Furthermore, the uncommitted movement’s campaign against Harris clearly had an impact in swinging enough voters to make a real difference.    Voters who support a third party must consider the impact of their vote. Casting a ballot in a tightly contested election for a candidate on the periphery such as Stein or Cornell West splits the core Democratic vote.  It’s an almost universal understanding that third parties don’t have the numbers to win presidential elections. Attempting to garner enough support behind a candidate who has ballot access in only 38 states with no pathway to victory was not a risky move. Instead, it seemed like a targeted, mismanaged approach that ended up swaying the election in favor of President Trump.  Third party, protest voters must take accountability for the role they played in spoiling election results. It's unfortunate that we find ourselves in a two-party duopoly. However, it’s plain math that any vote outside of the two major parties in the 2024 presidential election was a spoiler.  It’s important to vote for candidates you can negotiate with the most. While Stein may have been more receptive to the uncommitted movement, there wasn’t a pathway for her victory. Instead, we are in a situation today where the uncommitted movement has zero allies in the White House to influence Israel policy.  It’s vital to recognize that muslim voters, much like any other voting demographic, are not monolithic in the way they cast their ballots. The Biden Administration did not listen to voters in cities like Dearborn, Michigan, and as a result, they paid the price.  We also must accept the moral dilemma many felt while casting their ballot considering Trump and Harris’ stances on Gaza. However, it’s clear that Trump’s stated policy plan for the Israel-Gaza conflict was way more hawkish than Harris’.  There is blame to go around about the Biden Administration’s neglect to listen to muslim voices around the country since the onset of the Israel-Gaza war. However, a protest-vote campaign in the midst of the hotly contested 2024 presidential election made Trump’s more extreme stance on Palestine come to fruition.

opinion-this-nfl-draft-was-wild.html,OPINION: This NFL draft was wild,2025-05-01T00:00:00-05:00,Michael Tatten,"The 2025 NFL Draft last weekend was a wild one. This draft had one of the top prospects fall to day three, unexpected quarterbacks rise multiple rounds, crazy draft day trades and some of the most varied draft boards we have ever seen.  The draft is a three day event that took place April 24-26, 2025 at Lambeau Field, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, home of the Green Bay Packers.  This was the second highest attended draft since the NFL moved it out of New York and started sending it to various locations in 2015, amassing over 600,000 attendees.  All of these fans were in for a lot of unexpected drama as one of the top prospects coming into the draft, Shedeur Sanders, fell all the way to the fifth round of the draft. Shedeur was the quarterback for Colorado the past two years, changing the program with his father, Deion Sanders, who was the head coach for Colorado.  This came as a shock to many because Sanders was projected to be a sure-fire first round draft selection with ESPN’s draft metric giving him a 96% chance to go within the top 21 picks of the draft. Many mock drafts had Sanders going as high as number two or three overall in the draft.  The reasoning behind why Sanders fell in the draft is unknown to many NFL analysts that have ties with multiple teams. The fact that Sanders fell so far is baffling. Sanders was deemed as the most accurate quarterback in this draft by the majority of scouts.  Sanders absolutely has the talent and traits to have gone higher in the draft. The Cleveland Browns traded up to pick number 144, in the fifth round, selecting Sanders, ultimately ending his unanticipated fall in the draft.  The slide of Sanders, meant the rise of other quarterbacks in this draft. As quarterback is the most valuable position in the NFL, and there were quarterback needy teams, some unexpected prospects rose dramatically up the draft boards.  The most unexpected pick in maybe the entirety of the draft, was former Louisville quarterback, Tyler Shough. The New Orleans Saints selected Shough at pick number 40, shocking many people with this selection. Shough is an older prospect at age 25 and with multiple season-ending injuries in his career, many draft analysts didn't expect Shough to be taken this high in the draft.  A couple other quarterbacks that were surprising picks were former Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe being selected by the Seattle Seahawks, and former Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel being selected by the Cleveland Browns. Both are viewed as development quarterbacks with some potential.  In this draft, we also witnessed the second overall pick be traded by the Cleveland Browns to the Jacksonville Jaguars, where the Jaguars selected former Colorado star, Travis Hunter. Hunter is a phenom who is attempting to become the first NFL player to play both sides of the ball, full-time.  The Browns may have not gotten the two-way star, but they added a lot of value that can help them build up their team for the future. The Jaguars gave up a lot to get Hunter, but if Hunter turns out to become what they think he can be, the trade will be well worth it.  Many teams had players ranked very differently on their draft boards. Most years there is usually a consensus on most players, with a few outliers, but that was not the case this year.  The top five to 10 prospects were pretty much in agreement, but after that, one could have seen a team rank one player at number 10 overall on their board, and another team have that same player at number 50 on their board. This was the case for a lot of the prospects in this draft, making it an exciting draft to watch because of the variability.  On the other hand, the top five picks were somewhat known, meaning people had an idea what was going to happen, with prospects like Cam Ward, quarterback out of Miami, Abdul Carter, edge rusher out of Penn State and Travis Hunter rounding out the top three picks in the draft.  Scouts are also saying that the reason Shedeur Sanders fell was because of his father, Deion. Teams don’t want to have to deal with Deion constantly putting pressure on them to start his son. Scouts also say that many of the teams that were interested in Sanders were turned off by some potential character issues.  One anonymous NFL assistant coach said, “It was the worst formal interview I have ever been in in my life. He’s so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates … but the biggest thing is, he is not that good.”  The fact that Sanders fell in this draft was baffling and those who say he is not a good quarterback are wrong. Sanders now has the opportunity to go out and prove all of his haters wrong by becoming legendary.  The 2025 NFL Draft was full of shocking moves that led to a dramatic draft. The slide of a top prospect, the unexpected rise of quarterbacks, big time trades and the varying draft boards made for a great draft and entertainment for the NFL.

opinion-tiktok-is-the-new-facebook.html,OPINION: TikTok is the new Facebook,2025-03-13T10:10:00-05:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"Remember when Facebook was the center of everything happening in the world? Users shared news articles, political debates happened in the comments and viral misinformation spread like wildfire. Social media has always played a role in shaping public discourse, but Tik Tok has taken this to new heights. TikTok has become the go-to information source, often spreading misinformation for Generation z and Millenials, just like Facebook was for previous generations.  Facebook misinformation often came from clickbait media sites with sensationalized headlines. Even with this there was still an emphasis on written journalism, where users could click on an article and verify the information themselves. Videos on TikTok often skip this step entirely, giving influencers and creators access to the eyes of young users. Creators are able to create a parasocial relationship with these users, gaining more credibility in the eyes of viewers as they appear more relatable than a journalist.  Because of this, a significant portion of Gen Z and Millennials now rely on TikTok instead of historically accurate news outlets like The New York Times or the Associated Press. A 2024 study found that 39% of adults under 30 regularly get their news from TikTok.  Since TikTok doesn't have the same checks and balances as traditional journalism, it prioritizes engagement over factual reporting.  TikTok’s algorithm is designed to keep users engaged by showing content that aligns with their interests and beliefs. Unlike traditional news sites where readers can read a variety of stories from unbiased reporting, TikTok’s algorithm shows them content that they directly want to consume. This can reinforce the viewers own biases and viewpoints creating an echo chamber and leading to even more polarization between people.  TikTok’s misinformation problem is even worse than Facebook’s. Facebook faced backlash for its role in spreading misinformation. Lawmakers, journalists and the public pressured them into implementing fact checking on posts. While this feature isn't right all the time, it now works with third party face checkers in the European Union. and allows users in the United States to comment on the post’s accuracy. TikTok however does not have the same transparency, causing millions of people to consume unverified information daily, oftentimes without realizing it.  Despite its flaws, TikTok has done what Facebook never could: engaged younger audiences with news and brought attention to underrepresented issues. Independent journalists, activists and creators alike have used the platform to shed light on things mainstream media might have overlooked. It has given a voice to those who might otherwise go unheard. Even though there may be some benefits, this doesn’t outweigh the danger of unchecked information and the decline in trust of traditional sources.  While Facebook spread some misinformation, TikTok has made the spread even worse.  It has become the dominant platform where young people consume information daily. As Gen Z and Millennials continue to rely on TikTok as their primary news source, it’s more important than ever to develop media literacy skills, question the viral content and seek out reputable news sources. If this isn't taken seriously, there is a risk of living in a world where the truth is controlled by the most viral video, not by the most credible sources.

opinion-true-crime-culture-is-warping-our-reality.html,OPINION: True crime culture is warping our reality,2025-04-17T00:00:00-05:00,Hannah Nazarenus,"Anyone who watches true crime knows the feeling of turning off the podcast or Netflix documentary and immediately double checking the locks. Even though they aren't in any actual danger, the fear still lingers.  Over the past few years, true crime has become one of the most popular entertainment genres, especially among young women. What used to be a niche hobby has exploded into a billion-dollar industry, with podcasts, docuseries and influencer-run videos looking at real life cases. True crime content isn't just entertainment, it shapes how viewers think about safety, risk and fear, and it's not always for the better.  True crime stories often overrepresent rare, extremely violent crimes. The genre thrives on the most horrifying cases about abductions, serial killers and mysterious disappearances. The more shocking or violent a crime is, the more clicks it receives.  While statistically these types of crimes are incredibly rare, viewers who are constantly exposed to them can start to think they are more likely to happen than they actually are. Psychologists call this the availability heuristic where people make judgments on the likelihood of an event based on how easily they can recall similar instances.  When applying this to true crime, the more violent a crime is the more of a lasting impression it leaves on the viewer. This can then cause them to believe these criminal acts are more likely to occur. This is harmful for the viewers, because the more they believe danger is everywhere, the more they operate in a constant state of alert.  This change in behavior for the viewer isn't always healthy. After listening to hours of true crime podcasts it's hard not to see threats everywhere. Rachel Monroe, a true crime lover and author of Savage Appetites, believes true crime appeals to women in particular because it's almost a form of preparation. While holding car keys a little tighter at night or skipping solo walks may not seem like a big deal, when this fear starts to seep into daily life it can become paralyzing. The overconsumption of true crime doesn't make anyone safer, it just makes them more anxious.  Another issue that is often unaddressed is how true crime reinforces stereotypes, for both the victim and perpetrator. Many times these stories center on white middle class women who are seen as ideal victims. Meanwhile crimes against people of color, queer people or poorer individuals are ignored and underreported. Additionally, suspects are often framed in ways that play into harmful racial, mental health or class-based stereotypes. True crime can often paint a simplified picture subtly reinforcing existing biases that don’t reflect reality.  It’s true that some people argue true crime raises awareness, and in certain instances it does. Podcasts like Serial or The Murder Squad have looked at cold cases and drawn attention to the systematic failures in law enforcement and the investigations.  But, that's the exception. Most true crime content isn't driven by justice, it's driven by the shock value, views and revenue. When fear becomes entertainment, it stops citizens from trying to make the world safer and turns them into spectators watching behind a screen.  When used properly, true crime can bring awareness to injustice and give a voice to victims whose stories might be otherwise forgotten. More often than not it's become a form of entertainment that thrives on fear and the unknown. Everyone owes it to themselves to be informed, but they also deserve peace of mind. When viewers are constantly looking over their shoulders because of the content they consume it doesn’t make them safer, just scared.  So, the next time someone brings up the newest murder documentary or podcast, remember that awareness is a powerful tool, but only when it empowers, not when it paralyzes.",2025-04-17T05:00:00Z,2025,4,2025-04,OPINION,OPINION
opinion-trump-played-voters-with-his-part-in-project-2025.html,OPINION: Trump played voters with his part in Project 2025,2025-02-24T10:29:00-06:00,Dawson Iassilo,"President Donald Trump time and time again has boasted about his ignorance of Project 2025. Yet, everything he has implemented closely aligns with the more than 900 page writings of Project 2025. In fact, most of his cabinet members, down to his press secretary, have had a key role in constructing the documentation of Project 2025.  Project 2025 was constructed in 2022 by The Heritage Foundation and 140 former Trump staffers. The project strives for an extreme right-winged blueprint for the United States. The project rolls back federal agencies, federally funded corporations, several women’s rights protections, LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant rights, healthcare and racial equity to name a few highlights.  Trump has implemented more than a dozen policies that have closely aligned or flat out been written in Project 2025. Despite initial denials, Trump’s actions have followed through with Project 2025’s proposals to transform the government into his ideal conservative framework.  One of the objectives of Project 2025 was the dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion. DEI is the federal program that advocates for fair treatment of everyone. Whether that be handicapped parking spots or flexible hours for parents, DEI is everywhere, often without being recognized.  On page 258, Project 2025 states its promise to eliminate DEI in federal workplaces and education and eventually further its boundaries. Trump announced at his inauguration that DEI would be banned shortly, and that promise was fulfilled shortly after. His most recent hand in eliminating DEI was sending a threat to public schools that continue to use DEI and will no longer be federally funded.  From pages 417-448, Project 2025 takes a deep dive into their extremism rhetoric in terms of climate change and environmental rollbacks. Trump has been widely recognized as historically the worst U.S. president for the environment. Despite his condemnation of Project 2025, the things he spews align perfectly with what Project 2025 states.  On day one, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accords, the biggest climate change alliance in the world with over 200 countries as members.  Another announcement on day one was his advancements in the “Drill Baby Drill” agenda. This would increase carbon dioxide to over 4 billion tonnes.  Recently, he is reevaluating the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and teetering back and forth with the idea of eliminating it as a whole. This is the agency that helps with relief for cities affected by natural disasters and emergency situations.  With this, he is also working to cut the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The latest rollback was the cuts of over 3,000 national park and forest service workers nationwide. This represents about 15% of this field. All of these environmental protections that were abolished are written out in one way or another in Project 2025.  Probably Trump’s most notorious action so far in his second term has been his extreme immigration measures. The way he goes about deportation is written out to a tee in Project 2025. From pages 137-151, Project 2025 goes into incredible detail about how migrants should be treated and “handled.” The document views immigrants, of any sort, to be deteriorating our country.  Trump has denied knowing anything about Project 2025 and has disassociated with any implications of it. However, his supporters, cabinet members and the proposals he is turning into law completely contradict this.  At this point, there is no denying Trump’s implications in Project 2025. The exact page numbers in Project 2025 align perfectly with what Trump is trying to accomplish. The parallels in the document and Trump’s actions are far too similar to be a coincidence  Trump’s second term initiatives reflect a comprehensive adoption of Project 2025’s framework. Trump is trying to make a transformative era in America and is using the writings in Project 2025 as a guideline.  The alignments not only fulfill these conservative objectives but also contradict the Constitution, federal agencies and executive authority. The U.S. would suffer immensely if even half of the things in Project 2025 were put into place. At the rate that these extremist laws are being passed, America should be alarmed for what is to come.",2025-02-24T16:29:00Z,2025,2,2025-02,OPINION,OPINION
opinion-trump-s-dark-vision-from-day-one.html,OPINION: Trump’s dark vision from day one,2025-01-27T00:00:00-06:00,Bret Fulton,"The tone for a new administration coming into power every four years is typically one filled with optimism and hope. This is symbolic of the peaceful transfer of power, and is a tradition that was broken this previous inauguration day. President Donald Trump proved in his speech to the American public and the world that he will be quick to abandon his base of supporters and basic American ideas along the way.  On Jan. 20, 2025, Trump gave his first address to the nation as president in his second administration. The speech was filled with both political and personal attacks on the previous administration, along with promises to implement policies that directly contradict American values and the Constitution.  It only took a few hours for Trump to implement an unpopular executive order ending birthright citizenship for a child whose parent or parents are in the United States unlawfully. Not only does the policy lack public support, but also lacks a legal foundation considering it is in direct violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s citizenship clause.  It only took a couple of days before Federal Judge John Coughenour struck down the executive order. The signing of an order that is in such a clear violation of the Constitution is symbolic of what may be to come over the course of the next four years. Especially considering this was one of his first executive actions as president.  Symbolism enveloped every part of the inaugural ceremony. Technology industry CEOs such as Tim Cook, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerburg sat just behind the first family on the inauguration platform. It is clear who his next administration will serve.  Trump attempted to portray himself as a populist to the country and the world. However, we cannot take his claims seriously when he rolled out the red carpet for billionaires who will have disproportionate power and influence on our government compared to the millions of Americans that elected Trump into office. All of the technology billionaires on his inaugural platform benefit from millions of dollars worth of government contracts and thus represent a clear conflict of interest.  The new administration continues Trump’s commitment to upend tradition and precedent at every turn. Inaugural speeches are usually intended to be inspirational and unifying, especially after an extremely polarizing election. Instead, the American people got a speech that sounded like a divisive political rally.  Some may argue the speech was unifying and layed out a policy agenda. While he certainly did lay out his agenda for the next four years, the speech was far from being a traditional inauguration speech.  The American public voted for cheaper eggs and gas, not violating the Constitution by ending birthright citizenship or renaming the Gulf of Mexico. He wasn’t overtly vocal about these things while running for his second term, but is certainly loud about them now.  America made its choice on Election Day this past November. When it was time for the country to come together and unify for the collective good, Trump took the opportunity to continue to attack and divide.  Bret Fulton is a sophomore political science major.

opinion-trump-s-ideological-footprint.html,OPINION: Trump’s ideological footprint,2025-04-07T11:55:00-05:00,Dawson Iasillo,"In the unknown of American politics, one thing seems inevitable: the influence of Donald Trump’s policies and mindset will endure far beyond his time in office. Trump knows how to work a crowd and the idea of “Trumpism” will last beyond his presidency or his lifetime. Trump seemed to unleash a hateful rhetoric that will not go away when this term is over.  When Donald Trump started his first presidential campaign, many believed he was something new and different to American politics. He was not a lifelong politician so many had hoped he could turn politics around for the better. However, Trump has ripped the American people apart in ways that cannot be fixed in the near future.  Though his presidency will end, his imprint on the nation is undeniable. He has shaped the political, social and economic discourse in ways that will continue for years to come.  Trump supporters seem to follow him in a way that is unlike any prior politician. Many experts have even described Trumpism as a cult. These supporters have a mob mentality in unprecedented ways.  The Trump cult follows Trump’s beliefs. However, cults are not a simple thing to back out of. The ideologies and beliefs instilled in those individuals continue to live on for generations. There is no difference in this situation.  Trump is known for his deranged statements. Whether it be making fun of a handicapped reporter on national television, saying inappropriate things about his own daughter or even inciting an insurrection, Trump continues to gain unwavering support. There are few occasions when I agree with Trump, but when he said he could shoot someone and not lose any supporters, he wasn’t completely wrong.    This kind of blind following will not just stop when Trump does. He has ingrained himself in so many people for generations to come. He has used fear-mongering and a false sense of reality to warp people’s minds into not even slightly criticizing him. That mindset does not dissolve when a presidency does.  The long list of rolling executive orders from this Trump term continues to grow by what seems like the minute. There is no denying that these bills are extremely controversial and some are even unconstitutional.  The way checks and balances have been run into the ground will take decades to recover from. The federal government will need a complete restructure after this presidency which will take far longer than just a few years. If Trump has done one thing, it is show us the flaws and loopholes that the Founding Fathers missed.  Some may argue that Trump is just a far-right Republican. However, the Republican party has lost its identity as a whole. The Republican party used to encourage a more hands-off government. Trump has warped the party into wanting limited media, control of genders, name identifications, women’s healthcare bans and so much more. Plenty of middle-of-the-road Republicans have jumped on the Trump bandwagon. The division created by Trump will last far longer than Trump will.  While Trump just has a few more years in the political world, the ideologies and propaganda he has unleashed onto the public will not go with the end of his term. The can of worms has already been opened and it will take many years to recover from the Trump era.  Dawson Iasillo is a sophomore political science and journalism double major.

opinion-trumps-anti-war-lie.html,OPINION: Trump's anti-war lie,2024-12-04T00:00:00-06:00,Bret Fulton,"Since entering politics, Donald Trump has portrayed himself as being the anti-war candidate. However, what seemed like an anti-war promise to a large chunk of the American electorate quickly transformed into indiscriminate bombing and escalation. This may be a preview of what’s to come under his second administration.  In the 2024 campaign cycle, Vice President-elect JD Vance argued that the Trump campaign’s anti-war message resonated with working class America. Yet when President-elect Trump started the nomination process for his next administration, he nominated officials to diplomatic and defense positions who fit anything but his anti-war message. Similarly the Trump 2016 campaign ran an anti-war message by heavily criticizing his opponents’ support for the Iraq war. This was before he started escalating air strikes and tensions globally.  Political observers on both ends of the spectrum seem to agree that Trump’s anti-war platform was born from the sentiments of working class America. For decades, working people have seen their children and tax dollars being shipped off to conflicts where the reasons behind United States involvement were not clear.  In the 2016 campaign, Trump was able to tap into this backlash which perhaps was partially responsible for his election into the White House. It seemed at the time as though he had a mandate to de-escalate international conflict, decrease spending on war and implement a non-interventionist foreign policy.  Just a few months into Trump’s first administration, his foreign policy promises were quickly crushed. His administration escalated drone strikes by 432% and conducted more strikes in his first two years than Former President Barack Obama’s eight. His first military raid as president ended up killing an eight-year-old American girl, Anwar al-Awlaki. He further withdrew the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), otherwise known as the Iran Nuclear Agreement, which international observers stated was operating as intended in preventing Iran’s nuclear program.  Despite his campaign promise to craft more non-interventionist policy, Trump proposed and received sharp increases in military spending all four years. He further failed to withdraw the U.S. from Iraq and Afghanistan, though he did negotiate the terms of the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal.  While major international conflicts such as Israel-Gaza and Russia-Ukraine continue on, Trump’s first administration could be a preview of what’s to come. A continuation of breaking his anti-war, non-interventionist foreign policy promises seems all too likely.  Non-interventionist conservatives have once again been lied to about a massive revamp of American foreign policy. Instead, they have gotten quite the opposite: A policy of escalation that will continue to send American tax money and service members overseas for the foreseeable future.  Some may argue that Trump was an anti-war president since he did not get the U.S. involved in any new conflicts. While this is partially true, it is a narrow interpretation of what it means to be anti-war since Trump was anything but. A 400% increase in drone strikes that further escalated already volatile situations and withdrawing the U.S. from agreements bringing about more peace and security is the direct opposite of an anti-war stance. Obama too had no new wars under his administration, however, it would be wrong to consider him anything close to an anti-war president.  It fails to come as a shock to the public that a politician would lie about delivering on their campaign promises. However, considering Donald Trump has spent nearly a decade in American politics and four years as president, it is incumbent on the public to understand what his true policy goals are. In the 2024 election, the public was deceived again about his anti-war foreign policy, and we will once again pay the price.  Bret Fulton is a sophomore political science major.

opinion-unl-should-join-the-big-ten-defense-compact.html,OPINION: UNL should join the Big Ten defense compact,2025-04-30T15:33:00-05:00,Bret Fulton,"Since taking office, the Trump administration has centered its sights on higher education. The president has moved beyond the hallmark verbal attacks of his first term, and is now taking tangible, harmful action on university campuses. UNL and other universities around the country must meet these attacks with action, not complacency.  On April 11, 2025, a trilateral agency letter including the General Services Administration, the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services was sent to the Harvard University president. The list of demands included dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion focused programs, restructuring Harvard’s governance and reforming Harvard’s hiring and admissions practices.  The administration later claimed the letter was sent in error, after Harvard publicly declined to comply with the demands and subsequently had $2.2 billion worth of federal funds frozen.  While the withholding of funds in the past have been used as a measure to ensure civil rights compliance, the most recent withholding was nothing more than an attack on academic freedom and basic constitutional rights. Nonetheless, Harvard’s refusal to comply with the administration's demands protected their student body and faculty.  Universities should be the bastions of academic freedom and debate that aren’t tainted by government coercion. Institutions are supposed to protect both students and faculty from punishment for disagreeing with the president. Harvard took the bullet first, and therefore set the example for how institutions around the country should respond to similar demand letters.  Many Big Ten schools have created another method by which institutions can push back against government overreach. The proposal is a NATO-style compact in the sense that an attack on one Big Ten institution would result in the pooling of financial resources, academic support and even lawyers from all members of Big Ten schools.  The UNL faculty senate already voted to join the compact. However, official approval by university administration would further solidify the principles of ensuring access to academic freedom not just for UNL students, but students at all Big Ten institutions. This is the cornerstone of the role universities are supposed to play in civil society.  Students, such as Rumeysa Ozturk who criticized Tuft University’s response to student protestors in the student newspaper, must be protected from being whisked off the street for voicing an opinion the administration doesn’t like. Students and faculty should be able to freely pursue their academic interests, protest and speak out against policies they disagree with, without fear of retribution from the president.  Harvard set the example for private institutions in resisting the administration's unconstitutional demands. UNL should set that same example for public universities.  Many are correct to point out that not giving into the Trump administration’s demand letters will greatly harm the quality of education. This is especially true for public institutions that lack multi-billion dollar endowments. However, joining the Big Ten defense compact will help alleviate some of these concerns for UNL. The ability for universities to enjoy their constitutional rights should not be dependent on how large their endowment is or how wealthy their alumni associations are. They are rights that should be guaranteed to every college campus across the country.  As the administration challenges the role of higher education, students, faculty and college administrators should be at the front lines fighting back. We cannot allow the government to trample over vital institutions in civil society, and UNL needs to lead other public institutions around the U.S. in that resistance.

opinion-white-house-fact-sheets-are-not-reliable.html,OPINION: White House Fact Sheets Are Not Reliable,2025-10-17T00:00:00-05:00,Rose Woelm,"The White House website has a page titled “Fact Sheets,” with article after article of compiled information and statements that read more like an opinion section of a paper, one with far less professional standards. The White House has been releasing these pieces on its website since the beginning of President Donald Trump’s term. These quasi-press-release-style articles cover the major events of the week, Trump’s messaging and outlook on certain topics and executive orders signed.  These articles are published almost daily, flooding the website page with new content as quickly as it can be generated. While called “Fact Sheets,” they are far from it. There are no hyperlinks to any study, article, number, quote or event referenced in any of the articles, making it incredibly difficult to investigate claims further. This is a blatant disregard for professionalism, communication and government ethics, and is an attempt to present these statements as ultimate fact, as there is nowhere else to look for the same information without spending hours combing through documents.  The White House purposely leaves references out to avoid fact-checking. These “Fact Sheets” are unreliable, referring to numbers and studies that are incredibly difficult to find. With no direct link when citing figures found in a study or report, it can take hours to track down what is being referenced. This is not possible for everyday people, those who do not have multiple hours of free time to dedicate to checking sources.  It implies that the highest reference point is the White House, that they alone are supplying an adequate mode of proper information communication. It is basic communication and research practices 101 to cite your sources.  These “Fact Sheets” are written in an opinion format, not as a collection of facts to better inform the public.  Take one of the more recent ones, for example: “Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Develops New Strategy to Counter Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence.” The page covers the National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) that Trump signed in September. The NSPM will require various measures to combat what is referred to as political violence in the article, or activities that meet the criteria for domestic terrorist organizations.  The article references assassination attempts of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump, as well as the fatal shooting of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk. It also references the shooting of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, even though he was not a part of the right-wing political realm.  It conveniently leaves out the assassination of Minnesota Rep. Mellissa Hortman and her husband, and the attempted assassination of Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.  The page goes on to reference multiple numbers with no hyperlink or citation to show where the information is coming from. It is written in an opinion format with claims made about Trump’s character listed in bullet points at the end, saying he has “promoted patriotism” and “strengthened free speech.”  This may very well be some people’s opinion, but it does not make it a fact, and certainly should not be included in something titled “Fact Sheet.” Many of the sheets on the White House website end the articles with claims like these, typically praising Trump and tearing down political opponents.  Some of the sheets are more outright in conjecture than others. Going back to some of the first ones released, “Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ends DEI Madness and Restores Excellence and Safety Within the Federal Aviation Administration” is filled with opinion-style writing. It falsely claims that the Biden Administration started an initiative to hire people with “‘severe intellectual’” disabilities, psychiatric issues and complete paralysis over other individuals who sought to work for the FAA.  The FAA employs thousands of people in a wide array of positions, from administrative roles to critical safety-oriented ones. The initiative referenced can be found on the FAA’s website as early as 2013, and could be found on the website during the entirety of Trump’s first term in office. Not only is this an example of the blatant misinformation found on these “Fact Sheets,” but a viewer could click on any one of the sheets and find opinion after opinion rather than a collection of information.  These articles attempt to fix the claims made in them as the ultimate truth by appeal to authority. If it’s the government telling you it’s a fact, why look further into it? It’s in a “Fact Sheet,” and therefore must be a fact, right?  There are a few ways someone could look at this in a positive light; they would be wrong to do so, but one could spin this to say that those who write the Fact Sheets don’t mean to leave out things purposely.  This claim would argue that all the compilers of these articles are simply not detail-oriented enough, and apparently have never written any kind of research paper for school, to cite their references. This would mean they are all incompetent to the point of egregious unprofessionalism and complete lack of concern for research ethics or integrity.  The other view someone could have is that these articles are completely reliable and therefore do not need to have references listed since the government is the ultimate reference.  This is a troubling view to take. Even if we suppose every claim made is correct, it is still widely unprofessional, unethical and a complete disregard for research and media communication ethics to publish something titled “Fact Sheet” without any clue of how these facts were actually found besides the White House’s word. Beyond this, it is illogical to blindly trust any higher authority. These articles are basically saying, “trust me, bro.”  The White House Fact Sheets are not reliable since there are no references listed at any point. This is done on purpose to discourage further investigation into the claims made, to depict the White House as the highest reference point, encouraging blind faith and is written with absurd amounts of conjecture rather than a collection of factual information. In no way, shape or form can these articles realistically be called Fact Sheets.  Rose Woelm is a senior philosophy and journalism double major.

opinion-you-don-t-want-to-win-the-lottery.html,OPINION: You don’t want to win the lottery,2025-01-30T00:15:00-06:00,Sophie Farrell,"Millions of Americans buy lottery tickets each year with the hopes that they are going to be the lucky winner to seemingly endless fortune. While the idea of immediate wealth seems appealing to most anyone, the realities about the sudden change in lifestyle prove that some may be better off without their big win.  In 2002, Jack Whittaker won the biggest lottery at the time, cashing in at about $314 million. The money seemed endless to Whittaker, so he handed out money anywhere he could. He made generous donations to churches, diner waitresses, family and even strangers.  His life eventually went south to a fate he could only describe as cursed. His house burnt down, he had run-ins with the law, his wife divorced him and he lost his daughter to cancer and granddaughter to drugs. Nearly 18 years after his big win, he died at age 72.  While this is just one story, there’s dozens more like it. Winning the lottery doesn’t always equate to a happy life as winners often face future challenges.  After winning the lottery, one might think that there are no limits to what they can buy. They may quit their job, buy a car or two and maybe even go on an extravagant vacation.  What they don't realize is that they are putting themselves at risk of becoming a statistic. Data has shown that nearly 70% of lottery winners go bankrupt within a few years of inheriting their money because of the reckless nature of their spending with little to no financial plan.  David Lee Edwards is a sad example of this. Edwards and his wife’s lives were changed when they won a $27 million jackpot in 2001. After winning big, the couple bought planes, cars and mansions and managed to spend $12 million within the first month. Not even five years later the two ended up with drug addictions, living in a shed with no money to their name.  Once someone wins the lottery, the word also gets around fast. Friends, family, old coworkers, neighbors and distant relatives may reach out in hopes of benefiting from the winnings. It can get to the point where there is no telling whether or not someone is only connecting in hopes of getting money out of it. Even genuine relationships can change when this money is involved.  Unfortunately, the more people know about the winnings, the more of a target it puts on the winner’s back. They have a higher risk of being robbed, attacked or even killed.  After winning nearly half a million dollars, Urooj Khan of Chicago dropped dead prior to even cashing his earnings. This was later ruled a homicide, with the cause of death being cyanide poisoning, proving that these wins can turn lethal.  Regardless of how others feel about the increase in wealth, the winner will have to deal with a change of emotion within oneself as well. They may feel isolated from others, or even guilty for the sudden win. These spikes in emotion can cause erratic behavior    Micheal Carrol is an example of spending his winnings recklessly, which affected more than just him. He spent his $15 million dollar earnings on various drugs, which he shared with his daughter and granddaughter. Carrol would eventually find himself in jail with drug possession charges, and his daughter and granddaughter died from overdosing.  Some people argue that winning the lottery can be beneficial if the winners take the necessary steps to shield their assets. If the first thing a lottery winner does is tell all of their friends and family about the win, they have already done it wrong. An important factor of protecting one’s winnings is to keep it private and find a financial advisor to help with the next steps.  Although there are ways to win the lottery and live a fulfilled life, there are far too many stories that don't go according to this plan. Next time you find yourself buying a lottery ticket, maybe be grateful that your chances are only 1 in 300 million.  Sophie Farrell is a Junior Broadcasting and Journalism double major.

opinion-you-should-be-reading-opinion-articles.html,OPINION: You should be reading opinion articles,2025-02-20T11:35:00-06:00,Sophie Farrell,"Most online publications have an opinion section filled with unique perspectives on topics that are likely already of interest to the community. Reading opinionated writing can help widen perspectives on a topic, encourage critical thinking and may even spark a conversation. These are practices that will not only further educate the reader, but could help them understand those who think differently than themselves.  Far too often though, opinion writing is overlooked. Especially in the times we are in right now. People want the hard hitting news in a quick format. It is less likely that people find themselves sitting down to soak in others' outlooks on topics, unless it is one that aligns with their own.  This phenomenon is called confirmation bias and describes when people would rather interact with things that further their beliefs than challenge their way of thinking.  Most social media platforms are only furthering the confirmation bias with their algorithms. The more one interacts with content, the more likely that they will be shown content aligning with those same beliefs. In order to break down the confirmation bias, differing opinions will have to be actively sought out.  Luckily for readers, opinion articles are not hard to find. There are thousands of opinion articles that are waiting to help expand perspectives on a topic. Whether or not the reader knows this, they are learning something from every single article they read.  Perhaps an article builds off an idea that they previously aligned with and helps them learn more about the topic. Perhaps it doesn't. Maybe, a given article goes against everything that the reader believed.  This might make the reader angry or even make them feel like what they read was a waste of time. However, what they really did was gain perspective on another way of thinking, and allowed the article to spark emotion, which at the end of the day, is the goal of opinion writing.  Opinion articles are not just an outlet for someone to vent about a topic and spread false information. These articles are built upon facts and research that are organized in such a way that persuades a reader to feel something about a topic.  When reading an opinion piece it is likely that the reader is actively questioning the thoughts of the author, interpreting their views on the topic, evaluating what is being presented and ultimately allowing themselves to form their own judgements. They might not even realize at the end that they have actually practiced all of the forms of critical thinking. Just by reading one article, they have practiced thinking beyond the words on the screen and into their own thoughts and feelings.  One thing that opinion writers hope to spark after reading their article, is a conversation. Many assume that a hate message from a reader is disheartening for those who work in opinion writing, but for most it is the contrary. If someone feels so strongly about a piece of writing that they are willing to put emotion into a response to what they have read, the article has left an impact.  If there are no opposing views to an opinion, it really isn’t an opinion at all. Authors who write opinion articles do so to challenge the mind of the readers. Joining the conversation and giving feedback is allowing the author to experience the same type of critical thinking as the reader.  While there will always be people against opinion articles, claiming that they are not as necessary as the hard news section of the paper, there will be just as many people impacted every day from hearing a perspective on a topic different from their own.  At the end of the day, authors can’t force readers to read opinion articles. This is a decision that the readers have to make on their own. You must  have the desire to widen your world view and accept the differences that exist among our population. All of that might sound like a lot, but if you have gotten to the bottom of this opinion article, you have already made your first step.

opinion-you-should-start-coloring-again.html,OPINION: You should start coloring again,2025-03-06T15:28:00-06:00,Sophie Farrell,"Whenever I go to babysit, I secretly hope that the activity they choose is coloring. It's not often these days that I will sit down with a coloring book and a box of markers and allow myself to really enjoy the simple art that is coloring.  Most coloring books are typically geared toward younger children, because simply coloring can help them develop fine motor skills, understand spatial awareness and even learn self-control.  Once life gets busier, school gets harder and more technology is introduced into one's life, the coloring book might get shoved farther and farther back in the closet and lower on the priority list.  The benefits of coloring don't just stop at a given age, though. Coloring can have a positive impact on so much more than just a developing child, and can improve the lives of people of any age.  Coloring can have physical impacts on one's health and wellbeing. It can be used as a marvelous tool to relieve stress, improve sleep, decrease body aches, regulate heart rates and relieve feelings of anxiety.  Not to mention, the lack of judgement and competition that coloring provides. There is no pressure on finishing in a certain time or the fear of imperfections. Coloring can be used as a meditation of sorts, allowing oneself to tap into their breathing and heart rate, and getting a beautiful picture out of it too.  Taking time each night to color can replace other bad habits, like the overuse of technology. There is no doubt that with each new generation, the screen time is increasing more and more. In fact, the average screen time for a member of Generation Z is nine hours per day. Studies are even showing that nearly 50% of children between the ages of 0-2 regularly interact with a smartphone device.  Unlike coloring, screen time has shown time and time again to produce negative effects. Lack of sleep, mood swings and headaches are just a few of the many impacts that screen time can have on someone of any age. Choosing coloring instead, for even 30 minutes prior to going to sleep, can make a world of difference.  However, the reasons for coloring can be even simpler than better health and breaking habits. Maybe, an adult chooses to color because for that short period of time they don't have to pay attention to what's going on in the world around them. They can engage in an activity that will allow them to feel childlike again.  Many people are concerned with growing up because of the tales they’ve been told about being mature, proper or “acting your age”. Instead, maybe they would be happier if they allowed themselves time to forget all of that entirely and reclaim the curiosity that so many lose as they grow. An action so simple as coloring can help oneself tap into the joys of a child, which is absolutely necessary sometimes.  Not all coloring books are right for everyone. Some may prefer the books that are geared toward adults, with intricate designs that could take hours to complete. For some, that may turn them away from coloring entirely.

opinon-save-our-programs.html,OPINON: Save our programs,2025-09-19T00:00:00-05:00,Jocelynn Messersmith,"Students around the university walk on eggshells as budget cuts could fully eliminate their academic programs. While everything is still up in the air, there is still a chance for us to help those around us who are facing uncertain times.  On Sept. 12th, University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Chancellor Rodney Bennet announced an updated plan to reduce the university’s budget by $27.5 million. The plan was developed by university leaders to meet the expenses of rising operational costs and inflation.  The campus has already faced $75 million in cuts over the past six years. While the plan isn’t finalized, part of the proposal includes completely eliminating six academic programs.  As students at the university, we need to advocate for students who are in programs that are at risk of being eliminated by providing feedback to the Academic Planning Committee.  We can also speak out to the community and help people understand how these budget cuts will impact these students.  We need to understand what these cuts mean for students who are currently enrolled in any of these programs. While those currently enrolled will be able to finish out their degree, there is no telling what this means for staffing and career opportunities.  Junior landscape architecture major and community and regional planning minor, Nolan Novacek, explains how everyone needs to spread the message of the importance of his program.  “This profession has advocated for itself time and time again, and I believe the impact of our program should speak for itself,” Novacek said.  Novacek also said he is worried about what program cuts would do for his future career, as the landscape architecture program at UNL is vital for all midwestern landscape careers. Since the addition of the program, they have seen a 100% job placement.  If these programs do get cut, why would staff stay around and wait for classes to officially be done? How is the university going to ensure that professors don’t find jobs at other universities? What does this mean then for students in programs with fewer professors?  UNL needs to figure out how they plan on tackling these potential problems before leaving these students high and dry.  Chancellor Bennet also encouraged students to voice their opinions and concerns to the Academic Planning Committee. The APC is holding a series of hearings between October 1-10 to gather feedback from faculty, staff, students and stakeholders.  Details about exact dates and times are not yet released, but will soon be available. They are also offering an online feedback submission form that is available until Oct. 13.  The most important thing is to spread awareness of the importance of these programs. Posting on social media or reaching out to community members, explaining why we should all advocate for these students, is vital for a reconsideration by the board.  Doing a small act, such as having friends fill out the feedback form or being on the lookout for announcements by the programs at risk, is a lot more than leaving these students to advocate for themselves. It takes a big group to make a change and we need to stand up for our peers.  It may seem like our voices and feedback don’t matter to such a big university, but there is a reason why these decisions weren’t immediately finalized.  They are giving us a chance to take a stand and speak up to save these programs. The Academic Planning Committee needs to know why these programs need to stay and how eliminating any of these would be detrimental to the community and the university.  We have the chance to help save these programs that are at risk of elimination. While it is easy to watch how everything unfolds, we can step in now and let the Academic Planning Committee know the importance of keeping these programs at UNL. Save our programs and save our friends.  Jocelynn Messersmith is a sophomore journalism and broadcasting double major.

opinon-selling-queerness-not-representing-it.html,"OPINON: Selling queerness, not representing it",2025-09-26T00:00:00-05:00,Benjamin Korinek,"Queerbaiting isn’t representation, it’s exploitation. Media companies, celebrities and brands figure they can profit from hinting at queerness without ever committing to real representation. They pretend to embrace inclusivity, but instead leave LGBTQ+ people feeling taken advantage of and invisible.  Queerbaiting isn’t new, but now that fans demand more diverse representation, it’s become a convenient loophole.  The term refers to when creators of any kind (musicians, screenwriters, etc.) suggest queer relationships or identities to attract a wider audience, only to retreat before showing anything genuine. It dangles visibility without risking the “safety” of the mainstream approval. It’s a marketing scheme designed to profit off queer people who rarely see themselves authentically on screen.  The Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example. The studio has teased queer characters repeatedly, from ‘Avengers: Endgame’s nameless background cameo to ‘Eternals’ being marketed as having Marvel’s “first gay superhero.”  In 2021, queer people have existed forever, but Hollywood acts like putting us on screen would be the end of the world. Instead, queerness is treated like a publicity stunt. It’s something to sell, but not worth embracing.  In reality, these storylines are often minimal, sidelined or treated like marketing tools to lure more people into the theater rather than a genuine representation.  In music, Harry Styles has built much of his public persona around gender-fluid fashion and flirtatious onstage moments with men. Yet, he avoids labeling his sexuality, not letting queer fans know whether it’s authentic self-expression or just marketing.  The harm runs deeper than disappointment. Queerbaiting reduces queerness to a gimmick, turning lived identities into aesthetics or mysteries to be solved by fans. It frames queerness as something that must stay taboo, hidden and hinted at. That narrative recycles the same stereotypes and silences the LGBTQ+ community, which people have fought for decades to break apart.  Even worse, it delays the progress of authentic representation. Every time media executives choose to drag along audiences with vague “hints” instead of writing real queer love stories, they don’t allow actual LGBTQ+ creators’ voices to be heard. We get endless crumbs, and we deserve more. We deserve full, unapologetic representation of our lives, love stories and families.  Some argue that queerbaiting is at least a step forward, that it gestures towards queerness in ways that might normalize it for mainstream audiences.  However, queerness isn’t bad; it's real, it happens and people need to get used to seeing it. Visibility without authenticity isn’t progress; it’s just manipulation to meet sales. No one should have to water down who they are just to keep a fragile mainstream comfortable.  The demand for queer stories has never been louder, and yet mainstream media is still terrified to tell them honestly. Audiences deserve better than to be teased into buying tickets, albums or merch with promises that never materialize. If creators want to celebrate queer identity, they need to start delivering it as truth.  Benjamin Korinek is a sophomore journalism major.

staff-abdullah-s-choice-shows-the-value-of-education.html,STAFF: Abdullah’s choice shows the value of education,2014-01-13T00:30:00-06:00,NA,"In an era during which many college athletes view college sports as only a springboard to professional sports, an athlete sometimes surprises us by deciding to stand on that springboard rather than leap off it.  That was the case when Ameer Abdullah, a junior running back for the Nebraska football team, announced on Thursday that he would remain in Lincoln to complete his senior year of college  and improve as a football player  instead of leaving school for the hefty paychecks of professional football.  His statement, in part, says that finishing his education will increase his chances of succeeding in life. Abdullah, who has a shot at a career in the NFL, is looking beyond that potential. He knows there will be a life after football, and he wants to be prepared for it.  Students who aren’t athletes also often see college as a springboard to a real-world, lifelong career.  But they can learn from the example set by Abdullah and many other student athletes around the country who finish college before darting for fame and fortune in professional sports.  For all students, there’s life after and away from their careers. College isn’t just another rung on the ladder toward success in life. It’s a chance to learn, to be exposed to new ideas and a melting pot of viewpoints.  While there are chances to continue such education later in life for those who want it, students should take advantage of education while they can. Education isn’t just a line on a resume that employers come courting. It also offers a chance to learn about the world before entering it.  Ameer Abdullah passing up a potential shot at being drafted to a career in the NFL to stay in college can show students just how valuable an education can be and how they should take advantage of it here and now.  opinion@dailynebraskan.com",2014-01-13T06:30:00Z,2014,1,2014-01,STAFF,EDITORIAL
staff-college-students-cant-afford-not-to-have-insurance.html,STAFF: College students can't afford not to have insurance,2013-10-14T00:00:00-05:00,NA,"The Affordable Care Act has been called flawed, rushed, unconstitutional (but not by the Supreme Court) and even tyrannical. Since President Barack Obama’s signature legislation was enacted in 2010, Tea Party members have been unyielding in their effort to derail the law’s implementation, even going so far as to shut down the government to avoid funding it. Democrats have complained the law doesn’t go far enough in its attempts to provide care for tens of millions of uninsured Americans. Republicans have called it an unprecedented extension of the federal government’s authority.  But the fact remains: Starting Oct. 1, the Affordable Care Act’s centerpiece became the law.  As of the beginning of the month, not having health insurance is a punishable offense in the eyes of the federal government. That means the thousands of Nebraskans who aren’t covered could face tax penalties of $95 next year, with the figure increasing to around $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016.  With the host of insurance options now available through healthcare.gov, the continued operation of UNL’s student insurance program, Healthy Option and provisions allowing young adults to stay on a parent’s insurance until age 26, the argument that health care is simply too expensive is no longer convincing.  Especially considering the alternative: fines, fear of becoming sick and possibly unsubsidized medical bills. Any time students are surrounded by thousands of other active people from different places, sitting in classrooms and attending football games alongside students from other states and even countries, the risk of becoming sick is considerably high. Pair that with the added risk of flu season, which is in full swing, and the argument against health insurance right now is null and void.  People may disagree with the notion that it’s the federal government’s job to provide health care for the masses. They might believe health care isn’t a right like life, liberty and property are. And in the case of students, they might not believe health care is affordable, preferring to roll the dice with their health to save money. But now, it seems, the risk of getting sick outweighs the benefits of avoiding health insurance.  Until the law changes, those who don’t buy health insurance will pay a price.  opinion@dailynebraskan.com",2013-10-14T05:00:00Z,2013,10,2013-10,STAFF,EDITORIAL
staff-editorial-video-on-sexual-assault-isnt-most-proactive-solution.html,Staff editorial: Video on sexual assault isn't most proactive solution,2015-09-17T01:15:00-05:00,Staff,"The University of Nebraska-Lincoln clearly cares about its students’ safety.  Recently, the university sent out a video that students were strongly urged to watch pertaining to sexual assault awareness. The video, which is 45 minutes long, goes over scenarios of what is and isn’t sexual assault, how to report an assault and how to prevent it from happening.  Though we don’t doubt the university will take further steps to address sexual assault in the future, there has to be a better way to get the word out about awareness of sexual assault than a 45-minute long video sent to students in an email.  Our initial problem with the video itself.  It is ambitious to believe that students will watch a 45 minute video when they don’t have to.  Beyond the obvious fact that people should watch the video, there is no incentive to watching it. Nothing bad comes of not watching the video. In Franco’s email, it simply says “complying with the University’s expectation that you complete the online program is important.” But beyond that, nothing happens if a student doesn’t watch the video.  We believe there should be some sort of consequence for not watching it. For example, students should have to watch the video before being allowed to register for classes, or buying books. You can’t register for classes if you have a parking ticket. The same sentiment should be held if you haven’t been educated about sexual assault.  Without some sort of consequence or incentive, we don't think students will watch a 45 minute video just because the University urges them to.  A mandated viewing of the video is a good first step, but it should not be looked at as the saving grace. It should be looked at as the beginning of a conversation.  In addition, we believe there are better, additional ways to reach the student body at large to educate people about sexual assault.  The Bob Devaney Sports Center holds 13,595 people. Pinnacle Bank Arena holds 15,147. Why not bring in a speaker, or a group of speakers, and require students to go before they can register for classes, or buy student tickets to football games? Or host an open forum or speaker to talk about issues specific to UNL and to college students  Another alternative could be offering a zero or one credit hour class that all freshman are required to attend about sexual assault. The College of Journalism and Mass Communications requires all freshman students to attend a class called the Freshman Experience. UNL could offer a similar course, for all freshman to attend, where there could be a presentation about sexual assault.  The bottom line is this: we hope this video isn’t the university’s only, or main, solution to stopping sexual assault on campus. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is one of 106 universities around the country under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for a possible Title IX Investigation. Just the other week, a student sexually assaulted another student on campus in a dorm.  The video is a proactive first step. But we need more if something truly is to change.",2015-09-17T06:15:00Z,2015,9,2015-09,STAFF EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
staff-editorial-vote-yes-to-support-all-fund-a-users.html,"STAFF EDITORIAL: Vote ""yes"" to support all Fund A users",2016-03-09T00:15:00-06:00,Staff,"In lieu of endorsing a party on student election day, the Daily Nebraskan editorial board is instead encouraging students to vote “yes” in support of Fund A fee users, including those who have requested increases.  Today will not only decide who your next president is or who represents you in the senate – but also where your student fees go. We believe, whether or not you individually take advantage of these opportunities, voting “yes” to increase the funding of these programs does nothing but better the university as a whole.  This year, the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska, the University Program Council and the Lied Center for Performing Arts Discount Program all requested increases in student fees, amounting to a total increase of $2.76. The Daily Nebraskan and the DailyER Nebraskan did not request an increase. Though $2.76 may seem like a small increase, students in the past have been apprehensive to support Fund A increases. But we believe the increases this year are worth it.  Thanks to ASUN, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln student can walk up the Nebraska City Union stairs for free Student Legal Services and call 475-RIDE for a safe ride home at 2 a.m. The Good Samaritan Law, transgender housing and UNL’s Styrofoam-free policy all had their beginnings in the ASUN office. Last year, students paid $11.48 toward ASUN each semester. This year, ASUN has requested a $1.58 increase, to total $13.06 per student per semester. One dollar of this increase will go directly toward the Green Fund. We believe this is a beneficial investment. The Green Fund would provide grants for student-led projects dedicated to improving overall environmental sustainability. The increase goes beyond the ASUN office and has the potential to improve the wellbeing of each student on campus.  With UPC, students can watch blockbuster movies on campus at an affordable price, listen to entertainers speak for free and see artists like T-Pain or Dustin Lynch in concert. This year, UPC has requested a $0.79 increase, which would push their total to $6.28. The increase will fund additional diversity and education programming – events like those that have featured Laverne Cox and Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin’s mother. The topics UPC events cover run far beyond state lines and provide perspectives students aren’t likely to experience otherwise.  The final Fund A user asking for an increase is the Lied Center for Performing Arts Discount Program, which provides free and half-price tickets to UNL students for theatrical performances, concerts and more. A requested $0.45 increase – which would amount to $4.21 per student per semester – will add to the number of discounted shows available to students. An increased demand for these tickets proves the necessity of the discount program.  The Daily Nebraskan and its satirical counterpart, the DailyER Nebraskan, have not requested an increase in total funding and believe we too deserve your support. The DailyER uses a measly $0.14 of student fees per semester, which is a laughably low price. We obviously believe that the DN, too, deserves the requested funding. Due to the projected increase in enrollment, the DN’s fee per student per semester will actually decrease three cents to $2.95. We believe we provide an important service to the students – and if you need more convincing, here are 10 stories you would have missed without us this year.  The fact of the matter is this: Each Fund A user adds a unique and important perspective to campus. If you haven’t taken advantage of a show at the Lied, kept track of what legislation ASUN is passing or haven’t attended a UPC event, we not only implore you to do so, but also encourage you to vote yes to sustain these programs.",2016-03-09T06:15:00Z,2016,3,2016-03,STAFF EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL
staff-editorial-we-echo-nu-s-stance-on-student-speech.html,STAFF EDITORIAL: We echo NU’s stance on student speech,2016-09-29T01:00:00-05:00,Editorial Board,"In order to document what is likely the University of Nebraska’s most widely discussed controversy of student speech in recent memory, The Daily Nebraskan has compiled this special issue in an attempt to create a time capsule of the actions, reactions and responses that have transpired in the five days since Nebraska football players Michael Rose-Ivey, DaiShon Neal and Mohamed Barry took a knee while the national anthem played before the Huskers’ most recent game against Northwestern on Sept. 24, 2016.  At its core, this controversy is a simple matter of freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful protest. Each of these freedoms, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, are freedoms The Daily Nebraskan firmly supports.  The Daily Nebraskan Editorial Board echoes the statements made by NU President Hank Bounds, UNL Chancellor Ronnie Green and NU Board of Regents chairman Kent Schroeder, as well as the resolution put forth by the Association of Students of the University of Nebraska. Each of these campus influencers have eloquently expressed their support of not only the players’ freedom of expression and peaceful protest, but also the First Amendment rights of each University of Nebraska student, faculty and staff member. We are proud to be a part of a university that values the rights of its students.  The First Amendment is among the most crucial rights guaranteed to us in the United States Constitution. The ability to peacefully protest, as these players have done, is fundamentally important to a healthy and vibrant democracy. When issues arise within our country, it is irresponsible to curtail freedom of speech when it is exercised in a peaceful manner.  We also support the right of expression of those who disagree with the decision of the players to kneel. In fact, the members of this board have varying opinions on the action of kneeling during the anthem; however, we believe that disagreement should foster healthy debate, not seek to prevent it. These disagreements, as some — including campus and state leaders — have expressed, should not infringe on the rights of players to express themselves.  We do not endorse nor do we condemn the action of kneeling during the national anthem. Instead, we support the idea that the many sides of this debate each has the constitutional right to voice its opinion through non-violent means as the three Nebraska players have demonstrated.  There is nothing more important in a democracy than the free exchange of ideas. The Daily Nebraskan Editorial Board applauds the university for its role in preserving this exchange and is proud to be a part of this important dialogue.",2016-09-29T06:00:00Z,2016,9,2016-09,STAFF EDITORIAL,EDITORIAL

During Saturday’s game matching Nebraska against visiting UCLA, Husker fans have a heightened obligation to be anything but hostile.  When kickoff comes at 11 a.m., it will come under the cloud of a tragedy within the UCLA program that took place less than a week ago. Nick Pasquale, a redshirt freshman receiver for the Bruins, died Sunday morning after he was hit by a car. A moment of silence will be held at the game, and players from both teams will honor Pasquale by adorning his No. 36 on their uniforms.  But in the presence of a team that lost one of its players, those symbols of respect are the smallest Nebraska fans can offer. Those who attend the game must act as respectfully as possible toward a football team and fan base that have endured an emotionally taxing week.  The situation surrounding UCLA’s visit to Lincoln, while not comparable in scope, is reminiscent of Nebraska’s trip to Penn State in 2011, the week Nittany Lions’ coach Joe Paterno was fired after more than 40 years of leading the football team.  The atmosphere that week and at the game was an emotionally charged one, but the teams and fans treated each other with the respect necessary to alleviate a sensitive situation. Before that game, Nebraska running backs coach Ron Brown led a prayer for both teams at midfield.  Perhaps a similar scene could play out as the Huskers and the Bruins prepare for a football game that suddenly seems far less important than it did before. But fans need to treat one another with sensitivity in mind.  For Nebraska fans, that is normally not a problem — but this weekend, it is of the utmost importance.  opinion@dailynebraskan.com",2013-09-13T05:30:00Z,2013,9,2013-09,STAFF,EDITORIAL
staff-lincoln-crime-complicated-by-small-town-reputation.html,STAFF: Lincoln crime complicated by small-town reputation,2013-09-16T00:30:00-05:00,NA,"The peace of mind University of Nebraska-Lincoln students might feel when walking alone in downtown Lincoln — sometimes late at night — can be a blessing and a curse.  For all the hundreds of Lincolnites who stumble home safely after a night of drinking at a downtown bar, there’s surely someone passed out on a sidewalk, bleeding after a bar fight or even knocked out after being struck by a passing car while biking home.  Sure, the crime situation in the capital city could be worse. Students from Chicago, Kansas City and even nearby Omaha realize as much. Residents of these Midwestern cities are well-versed on which neighborhoods to find safe entertainment in and which ones to, if possible, avoid (though avoiding crime in Chicago is starting to seem more impossible by the day).  But crime in Lincoln is more complicated. With UNL students, young professionals and the varying levels of wealth dispersed throughout the city, illicit activity in Lincoln is not only harder to map, it’s harder to predict.  A 2010 study by the Center for Public Integrity showed students are notorious for neglecting to report crime. The report stated that 95 percent of rapes on college campuses are not reported to police. Lincoln residents should be wary of the fact that, despite Lincoln’s reputation as a safe haven for college students – a mid-sized city with that small-town feel — assaults, rapes and even murders occur within the capital city’s borders. Students often suffer the moral dilemma of witnessing crimes at parties and deciding whether to report them, especially when it involves their friends.  However, they can encourage a reduction in crime by ensuring that police have accurate numbers on the books. Lincoln’s somewhat-sparse police force, with 1.22 officers per 1,000 citizens, has been shown to efficiently protect city residents with the resources it has. But law enforcement is not perfect. And crime is, frankly, unpredictable.  Students should feel comfortable in Lincoln, knowing crime in the capital is relatively low compared with the situation nationwide.  But they should walk the city’s streets with the caution they’d need anywhere else.",2013-09-16T05:30:00Z,2013,9,2013-09,STAFF,EDITORIAL

During the past few weeks, there’s been a lot of buzz in Lincoln about coming and new attractions: Pinnacle Bank Arena, the West Haymarket Entertainment District, a revitalized Nebraska Union. These projects are critical to keeping Lincoln shiny and growing, but they alone are not enough to keep young people here in the long run. Ultimately, the decision to make Lincoln attractive to the young and educated rests in the hands of those masses themselves.  In Monday’s edition of the Daily Nebraskan, readers will find a package of comprehensive stories detailing Nebraska’s “youth drain” – the migration of people under 25 to other states – and an accompanying decrease in statewide brainpower. It’s a vicious cycle: Nebraskans find employment, living and entertainment elsewhere – sometimes in hipper, seemingly more progressive locales – and stain Lincoln’s allure in the process. But Lincoln can never become a vibrant, attractive city if intellectuals and creatives keep darting for the coasts, large metro areas and even Iowa as soon as they receive their UNL degrees.  Many students and grads, perhaps, can take a lesson from the newest chef de cuisine of Jack & June’s, a restaurant coming to Lincoln’s West Haymarket district. Colin Kennedy, 22, figured he’d move home to Omaha or even go west to California upon graduating in December.  Then he got an offer he couldn’t refuse: head a team of young cooks and even incorporate some of his Grandma’s recipes as founding member of a restaurant among the city’s newest. For Lincoln residents, opportunities like this are no coincidence. Those looking to make their mark on budding industries like tech and social media will find oases in companies like Hurrdat and Hudl, the former being a digital marketing agency and the latter a software developer for coaches, athletes and recruiters.

Finding that button-mashing male layabout in real life isn’t hard – especially on a college campus – but that doesn’t mean he is the only kind of gamer.

Perhaps they’ve contributed to the lack of dynamic female characters in popular video games today, which gamers male and female lament in Monday’s Daily Nebraskan gaming package. When “Grand Theft Auto V” came out late last month, a Gamespot reviewer docked the game one full point for its misogynistic portrayal of female characters.  Gaming is everywhere nowadays. It’s no longer a console-specific affair. Think about your smartphone’s home screen, your PC or Mac, your iPad or Android tablet and all the times you’ve played Angry Birds on it. With video games’ ubiquity, perhaps it’s time we as a society part ways with the gamer stereotype.

The state has three members in the House of Representatives and two senators. But those five lawmakers have managed to embarrass the state during the past two weeks with their contradicting and hypocritical statements about the issue that’s on everyone’s mind: the government shutdown.  First came Republican Rep. Lee Terry when he went public about his refusal to give up his paycheck during the shutdown.  “I’ve got a nice house and a kid in college, and I’ll tell you we cannot handle it,” Terry told the Omaha World-Herald last week. “Giving our paycheck away when you still worked and earned it? That’s just not going to fly.”  He later took back the comments and agreed to have his pay withheld until the end of the shutdown, but the damage was done.  New Sen. Deb Fischer has also been vocal about her views on the shutdown. A strong opponent of Obamacare, Fischer has always been on board with the mission to make defunding for the Affordable Care Act part of the House’s budget bill.  Whether you’re a proponent of Obamacare or not, this shutdown isn’t a good idea. Sen. Mike Johanns is the only Nebraska senator who seems to realize this.  “I don’t believe it’s the right pathway to shut down the government to prove a point or send a message or get your way,” he told the Lincoln Journal Star.  Fischer disagrees.  She recently signed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s letter pledging to continue the shutdown unless Obamacare is defunded.  “It’s time we sit down, negotiate and get the government open,” she told the Lincoln Journal Star.  Sorry, what about that signature on Cruz’s letter symbolizes negotiation? Fischer claims to be anti-shutdown, but her actions say otherwise.  Meanwhile, Rep. Adrian Smith is adopting a similar position to Fischer’s. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, on the other hand, says he doesn’t support a shutdown based on defunding of Obamacare.  That makes two Nebraska legislators who favor the operation of the federal government and the carrying out of already passed and signed legislation. Two out of five isn’t enough – it’s an embarrassment.  opinion@dailynebraskan.com",2013-10-10T05:30:00Z,2013,10,2013-10,STAFF,EDITORIAL

The Daily Nebraskan’s Editorial Board finds this deeply troubling. Collectively, the reasons the College Republicans gave for removing the student from their meeting boil down to a deep-rooted intolerance for others who don’t share the same (political) beliefs as they do. Moreover, the organization embraces — and is actively pursuing — an exclusionary policy that effectively isolates the group from anyone who disagrees with its views.  There’s nothing wrong with wanting to surround yourself with like-minded individuals. There are several quotes about the benefits of doing so on the Internet somewhere. There are also several quotes on the Internet about the importance, and indeed, the invaluable benefits one receives by engaging with those who share different, but not incompatible, beliefs. Embracing the risk of being trite, we’d like to point out that our university should be a place where we all collectively strive to achieve the latter.  The undercurrent of fear and mistrust that belies the actions of the College Republicans is a consequence of our country’s ever-present undercurrent of fear and mistrust of those who idle on the other side of the aisle. However, it’s worth pointing out that these aisles, divisions, parties and beliefs are social constructs. Meaning, our actions reinforce or dismantle these divisions; they build trust and acceptance or breed distrust and intolerance.  It would be overly simplistic to deride the College Republicans for alarmingly blatant discrimination — to stop there is to take the easy way out. What’s necessary here is the need for a serious and open dialogue about divisions and beliefs and our roles in creating and sustaining them.  Unfortunately, we’ve inherited all of our forefathers’ hatred, fears, indomitable pride and the impossibly resilient conviction that our beliefs are or at least should be universal.  Remember that we have a choice.  We don’t have to internalize this hatred, this fear, this pride, this conviction — we can do better.  opinion@dailynebraskan.com",2013-09-12T05:30:00Z,2013,9,2013-09,STAFF,EDITORIAL
staff-university-infrastructure-shouldve-been-considered-before-setting-enrollment-goal.html,STAFF: University infrastructure should've been considered before setting enrollment goal,2013-11-08T00:30:00-06:00,NA,"University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Harvey Perlman announced Thursday the need to push back the 30,000 student enrollment goal from 2017 to 2020. In his message he admitted the infrastructure and support needed for these numbers would take more time than he initially anticipated.  UNL’s current enrollment is about 25,000 students. In terms of living conditions, these students have experienced difficulties with crowded parking and incomplete residence halls. For additional facilities, the Campus Recreation Center is behind schedule on its expansion project, and the University Health Center is continuing changes to staffing and management. If the university is struggling to support 25,000 students, it certainly isn’t equipped to shoulder the burden of 30,000.  These are all important factors that should be considered for the welfare and satisfaction of students. A lot of effort, time and money are required to complete a university degree. Although UNL has seen an increase in retention and graduation rates since 1990, students are continuing to need five and even six years to complete their degrees.  In his address, Perlman said he didn’t want to compromise on the quality of experience that UNL provides for its students. Perlman also explained that teaching facilities and number of staff members need to be expanded before new students can be accommodated. This is a correct assessment, and addressing these issues before adding more strain to them is a wise decision on Perlman’s part.  But perhaps these difficulties of infrastructure should’ve been considered before the initial goal was set. It’s certainly admirable to want to attract more young people to the opportunities in our state, but touting an under-researched, over-ambitious goal that later necessitates a step back is a waste of everyone’s time and energy. As it is, every student deserves a positive experience, and the primary goal of the university should be to fulfill its current needs.  opinion@dailynebraskan.com",2013-11-08T06:30:00Z,2013,11,2013-11,STAFF,EDITORIAL
staff-university-should-hear-students-opinions-on-tuition-changes.html,STAFF: University should hear students’ opinions on tuition changes,2013-11-21T00:30:00-06:00,NA,"The possibility of a flat-rate tuition plan for University of Nebraska students, as announced by NU President James B. Milliken on Nov. 13, carries pros and cons for students. On one hand, a student taking 18 credit hours would pay the same amount for tuition as a student taking 12, presenting an incentive to take more classes and graduate more quickly. On the other hand, a student taking 12 credit hours would pay the same amount as one taking 18. Many students have jobs and activities that force them to take few classes each semester, and they would be penalized financially.  Either way, the decision to install the block tuition plan or not presents an opportunity for university administrators to do their homework and allow students to weigh in on the debate.  In mentioning the plan, Milliken made no allusion to research that may have been done on the effectiveness of flat-rate tuition. The Daily Nebraskan Editorial Board hopes adminsitration will look into how block tuition plans fared for other institutions. Without that research, how could they learn from the experiences of other schools that took block tuition for a test drive? It would be foolish to take on this plan without first looking into its efficacy with other universities that have tried it.  And who better to comment on the merits and pitfalls of the plan than the people it would affect the most? The student body should have a louder voice when it comes to decisions of this magnitude.  Take, for example, administration’s former plan to privatize the University Health Center. The plan was eventually voted down in June, but regardless, UHC employees and students had very little input in the proposal in its infancy. The Association of Students of the University of Nebraska in March said the university should consult students for future decisions. And the decision concerning block tuition offers that opportunity.  In short, if Milliken wants to see this plan come to fruition, we hope UNL administrators do their research first — and that includes asking us what we think, too.  opinion@dailynebraskan.com",2013-11-21T06:30:00Z,2013,11,2013-11,STAFF,EDITORIAL
turning-20-life-lessons.html,OPINION: Life lessons since 20,2024-05-06T00:00:00-05:00,Kennedy Lawrence,"As is the case for many, turning 20 smacked me right in the face. My teenage years dwindled away and suddenly, I was a bona fide adult.  Even through the rollercoaster of mood swings, my teenage years brought me experiences I wouldn’t change for the world.  I’ve heard people talking about the trials of being in their 20s, but my brain never allowed me to fathom that I would be in their shoes so soon. Though I’ve only been 20 for a few short months, I feel as if I’ve grown years through the lessons I’ve learned.  One of the primary aspects of turning 20 that I noticed is how relationships change. I’ve made groups of friends throughout my life based on school, my extracurriculars or through my family. I consistently had at least a few friends I could count on who shared common interests.  Nonetheless, these friends weren’t typically the same from year to year. It seemed as if I’d move to another grade or sport and new friends replaced the old ones in a smooth exchange.  Since turning 20, I feel as if the relationships in my life are always intentional. No longer are the days where proximity determines my relationships. There’s no pressure to keep relationships with people I dislike because I’m scared of running into them in the hallways. Now, I can find people with interests I seek out on my own and get to choose to keep people in my life.  Therefore, all of my relationships since turning 20 have been building me up. The people in my life are one of a kind and support me through thick and thin.  I’ve additionally noticed that with each new day of being 20, I get one step closer to becoming like my mom. The other day my hands danced around in gestures as I told a life lesson story to my younger brother. Halfway through the story, he just started laughing, saying I have the exact mannerisms our mom has.  My mom always warned me that she turned into a carbon copy of her mom and someday I would do the same; I never believed her until recently. As I turned 20, I suddenly gave out motherly advice to my siblings, made her jokes and viewed the world through her eyes.  Though it pains me to admit, she may be right about more than I thought, I have to confess she does know a thing or two. Luckily, my mom is someone I’m incredibly proud to be turning into.  I finally learned that while the awkward stage of adolescence isn’t fun, it unfortunately doesn’t get much better in your 20s, either.  It seems as if I’ve gone through a second maturity since I turned 20. Unexpectedly, my jeans stopped fitting, new acne scattered across my forehead and those mood swings returned. Just when I thought the coast was clear from my war of adolescence, I was proven to be incorrect.  Nonetheless, this 20s maturity brought an upside in my overall confidence. While all of these physical changes occurred, within myself I felt more secure than ever. If I had told my teenage self that since turning 20 I’ve taken on two leadership roles, I wouldn’t drop dead. The awkward and shy teenager within me went away as I grew a voice to lead my peers.  While many of these changes started during my teenage years, they blossomed once I turned 20. A new decade brought a renewed version of myself that’s ready to take on adulthood.  One’s 20s truly does seem to be a pivotal time frame in life. I never thought I’d maintain such a solid group of friends or gain a confident voice, but 20-years-old surprised me.  Kennedy Lawrence is a sophomore journalism and ADPR double major.

For some of us, 2016 wasn’t the best year. Daily newspaper headlines made it seem as though everything that could go wrong, did. Between ongoing international conflict, celebrity deaths and, for some, damaging U.S. election results, this past year left us asking, “What’s next?”  Although not everything we reported on here at The Daily Nebraskan was uplifting, there were certainly stories that served as reminders that 2016 wasn’t a waste. For those of us who felt like 2016 let us down, we can remember some of the great things that happened on campus:  A 72-year-old woman enrolled as a freshman English major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Students without plans for Thanksgiving were invited to spend the holiday with their graduate teaching assistant.  A member of the Greek community began a project aimed at starting a conversation about why exercise is a good way to improve both physical and mental health.  And let’s not forget the free donuts. University of Nebraska President Hank Bounds gave 600 students a much-needed study break in the Adele Hall Learning Commons when he provided free Dunkin Donuts.  As for 2017, we can’t promise every Daily Nebraskan story will be happy. We’ll tell the stories our readers need to hear – whether they’re disappointing, scary or anger-inducing. We hope, though, that the stories you read here will be news worth sharing.
